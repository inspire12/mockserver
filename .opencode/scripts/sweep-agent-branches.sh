# Delete agent branches that no longer have a worktree and are already merged.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SCRIPT. Doing it by hand is where it goes wrong. The obvious
# inline version builds a list of "branches that still have a worktree" and then
# pattern-matches against it — and a newline-separated list matched with a
# space-separated pattern silently protects nothing. That exact mistake was made:
# every live branch fell through to the delete. Nothing was lost, but only because
# `git branch -d` independently refuses a branch that is checked out somewhere. The
# guard contributed nothing; the backstop did all the work, and a clean result made
# it look like the guard had worked.
#
# So the protected set is compared with `grep -Fxq` — fixed string, whole line — and
# there is a self-test below that asserts a checked-out branch is actually SKIPPED
# rather than merely refused later.
#
# SAFETY
#   * `-d`, never `-D`. An unmerged branch must survive and be reported, because it
#     is someone's unpushed work. (Note `.opencode/rules/worktree-workflow.md` Step 8
#     uses `-D` for the single branch a session just merged — that is a different,
#     narrower case, and still worth knowing about.)
#   * Dry run unless `--delete` is passed. Listing what would go is the default.
#   * Only `worktree-agent-*` branches are ever considered.
#   * Containment is checked against origin/master before deleting.
#
# Usage:
#   .opencode/scripts/sweep-agent-branches.sh            # show what would be deleted
#   .opencode/scripts/sweep-agent-branches.sh --delete   # actually delete
#   .opencode/scripts/sweep-agent-branches.sh --self-test
