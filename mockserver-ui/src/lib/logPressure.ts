/**
 * Reads the event-log loss counters MockServer exposes on its Prometheus
 * metrics endpoint (`GET /mockserver/metrics`), split by cause so the
 * dashboard can give the remedy that fits:
 *
 * - `mock_server_dropped_log_events_total{reason="ring_full"}` — events dropped
 *   because they arrived faster than the single logging thread could record
 *   them (lower the log level; a bigger `ringBufferSize` only absorbs bursts).
 * - `mock_server_dropped_log_events_total{reason="in_flight_bytes"}` — events
 *   dropped because the bodies waiting to be logged exceeded the in-flight
 *   byte cap.
 * - `mock_server_evicted_log_entries_total` — recorded entries evicted, oldest
 *   first, by the retention bound (`maxLogEntries` / `maxEventLogSizeInBytes`).
 *
 * A server that predates the `reason` label exposes one unlabelled drop series;
 * its value, and any reason this dashboard does not know, is reported as
 * `unattributed` so no drop goes uncounted. Every counter is only present when
 * the server was started with metrics enabled; absent counters read as 0.
