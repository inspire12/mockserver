/**
 * What MockServer's event log had lost when a verification could not be trusted.
 *
 * An upper-bound verification (`never`, `atMost`, `exactly`, `between`) fails
 * rather than passes once the event log is no longer a complete record. The
 * `VERIFICATION_FAILED` log entry then carries, as a message argument, the same
 * counts and bounds the REST client gets in the failure message. Only the causes
 * that happened are present, and every count is since the event log was last
 * reset.
 *
 * The field names are the server's (`MockServerEventLog`); the shared fixture
 * `__fixtures__/incompleteLogVerificationFailure.json` is checked on both sides.
