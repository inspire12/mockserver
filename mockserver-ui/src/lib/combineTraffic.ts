/**
 * One list of captured traffic, newest first, with one row per request.
 *
 * The server sends two overlapping windows: `recordedRequests` holds every
 * request it received (proxied ones included, for the Received Requests panel)
 * and `proxiedRequests` holds every forwarded exchange. Simply concatenating
 * them shows a proxied request twice: once without a response, once with the
 * upstream's. A received row whose `correlationId` matches a proxied row is
 * dropped in favour of the proxied one, which carries the response. A received
 * row of a request still in flight (no proxied row yet) is kept.
 *
 * Both inputs are newest first; the result interleaves them by `timestamp`
 * (the server's `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`, which sorts as text), keeping each
 * input's own order where timestamps are missing or equal.
