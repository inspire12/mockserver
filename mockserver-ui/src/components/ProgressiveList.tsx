 * elements rather than 50k, so scrolling, filtering and appending stay smooth.
 *
 * The data contract is unchanged from the previous idle-batched implementation —
 * callers still pass `count`, a stable `getKey(index)` and `renderRow(index)`,
 * and ordering/selection/append semantics are driven entirely by the caller's
 * data. Only the *rendering* strategy changed: instead of progressively mounting
 * every row, the list windows them.
 *
 * Rows may have variable height (entries expand/collapse), so heights are
 * measured dynamically via `measureElement` rather than assumed fixed.
 *
 * The list scrolls inside the nearest scrollable ancestor (the panel's scroll
 * area), which it discovers on mount via a stable probe element — it does not
 * introduce its own scroll container, so the panel's auto-scroll-to-top
 * behaviour keeps working.
 *
 * Render strategy by phase:
 *  - First paint (scroll viewport not yet resolved): render only `initial` rows,
 *    so the first mount is cheap even for a 50k-entry list. A layout effect then
 *    resolves the scroll ancestor synchronously before the browser paints.
 *  - Viewport resolved with a usable height: window the rows.
 *  - No scrollable ancestor, or a zero-height viewport (non-layout/headless
 *    environment such as jsdom, or a panel laid out at 0px): render every row so
 *    the full set stays reachable when windowing cannot run.

  // --- Scroll anchoring against changes ABOVE the reader --------------------
  //
  // These lists render in console order — oldest first, newest APPENDED at the
  // bottom. An arrival lands below the viewport and shifts nothing the reader is
  // looking at, so the common case needs no compensation at all.
  //
  // What still moves the reader is a change ABOVE their viewport-top row. The
  // server caps a dashboard panel at 100 rows and evicts the OLDEST — the rows at
  // the FRONT — as new ones arrive, so under load the list collapses upward; and
  // rows above the reader are re-measured as they expand/collapse. Either way the
  // total height above the reader changes while `scrollTop` does not, so the
  // content they are reading slides up (or down) and, once it leaves the window,
  // unmounts. That reads as an opened item "closing".
  //
  // Two properties of the real data make the obvious fixes wrong:
  //
  //  * The list LENGTH does not change. With the cap saturated the panel evicts
  //    one row for every row it appends, so on any server that has handled more
  //    than 100 entries the count is constant forever. Anything gated on the
  //    count growing is inert exactly when traffic is live.
  //  * The anchor row can be UNMOUNTED by the same update. After the window is
  //    recomputed from the unchanged `scrollTop` it points at different rows, so
  //    the row we want to hold onto is frequently not in the DOM by the time a
  //    layout effect could measure it.
  //
  // So the anchor is resolved from the virtualizer's measurements instead of the
  // DOM: it measures every row, mounted or not, keyed by the caller's stable
  // `getKey`. We remember which row was at the top of the viewport and how far
  // its top sat above it, then restore that relationship after the update.
  //
  // CSS `overflow-anchor` cannot do this: the rows are `position: absolute`,
  // which browsers exclude from native scroll anchoring, and windowed rows leave
  // the DOM entirely.
