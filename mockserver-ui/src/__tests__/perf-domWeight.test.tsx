/**
 * REGRESSION GUARD: how much DOM the dashboard mounts for a full dataset.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE MEASUREMENT THAT MATTERS. The server caps each panel at 100
 * items and throttles to ~1 push/sec, so the client never accumulates an
 * unbounded list and the store's per-push CPU is bounded (measured in
 * `src/__bench__/storePush.bench.ts`: 1.8 ms at REST body sizes, 12.5 ms at
 * 8 kB bodies). What is NOT bounded is the DOM: a panel that mounts one row
 * element per item mounts ~11-22 elements per row, and re-renders all of them
 * whenever the items change. At 200 rows that is ~2,200 elements rebuilt on
 * every push under load — an order of magnitude more work than the store does.
 *
 * DOM ELEMENT COUNT, not milliseconds, is what this file asserts on. Wall-clock
 * numbers under jsdom on a shared CI agent are not reproducible enough to gate;
 * element counts are exact, deterministic, and are the thing that makes the
 * page heavy. The timings below are recorded for orientation only and are NOT
 * asserted.
 *
 * MEASURED (2026-09-21, macOS arm64, node v22.21.1, jsdom, 400 B bodies; mean
 * ms for one `applyMessage` with the panel mounted):
 *
 *   Panel                        rows   DOM elements   1 new   all new
 *   TrafficInspector, un-windowed 200   2,234          37.7    126.0
 *   TrafficInspector, windowed     50   145            -       -
 *   TrafficInspector, windowed    200   145            -       -
 *   LogPanel, all rows mounted    100   2,220          59.0    190.8
 *   LogPanel, windowed            100   220            16.1     41.0
 *
 * Both panels now render their store array through `ProgressiveList`, so the
 * windowed row markup is the SAME data rendered by the SAME component; the only
 * difference is whether `ProgressiveList` could resolve a scroll viewport. That
 * is the size of the virtualization lever: for TrafficInspector the DOM is now
 * FLAT in the dataset — 145 elements at 50 rows and at 200 rows alike — against
 * ~2,234 un-windowed at 200. (`TrafficInspector` was virtualized 2026-09-21;
 * before that it rendered `filtered.map(...)` directly and this file pinned only
 * a per-row budget, since the windowing invariant did not yet apply.)
 *
 * THE jsdom LAYOUT FACT this file works around: jsdom DOES resolve the emotion
 * `overflow-y: auto` on each panel's internal scroll Box, so
 * `ProgressiveList.findScrollParent` FINDS a scroll ancestor — but jsdom reports
 * its `offsetHeight` as 0, a zero-height viewport, so `ProgressiveList` takes its
 * "no usable viewport" branch and renders EVERY row (the full set stays
 * reachable when windowing cannot run). That is why, with no stub, both panels
 * mount their whole dataset in jsdom — exactly as they did before virtualization,
 * which is why every other test in the suite is unaffected. The per-row budget
 * test below relies on it: with the whole dataset mounted, per-mounted-row cost
 * is (elements delta) / (mounted-row delta).
 *
 * To exercise the WINDOWED branch, the guards stub `offsetHeight` to 600 px (for
 * every element) so the discovered ancestor has a real viewport; the extra
 * `data-scrollhost` -> `overflow-y: auto` override is a harmless belt-and-braces
 * anchor. The stub is scoped to this file and removed in `afterAll`.
 *
 * NOTE the windowed row carries ONE extra wrapper `<div data-vrow>` that
 * `ProgressiveList` adds per mounted row, so the per-mounted-row budget below
 * (12.0, was ~11) includes it. That is bounded overhead on a handful of mounted
 * rows, not on the whole dataset — which is the entire point of windowing.
