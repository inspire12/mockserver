/**
 * THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT, in its most natural form: "when I open an item the
 * panel still refreshes and I can't read that item."
 *
 * In these panels a row expands INLINE, which changes Panel's `children` and so
 * re-fires the tail pin. While following, that scrolls the row the reader just
 * opened up and away; and because the hold is gated on `!follow`, the row is not
 * held either, so within ~10s at ~10 req/s the capped window drops it and the
 * expansion vanishes outright.
 *
 * Opening a row therefore stops following, which suppresses the tail pin and
 * engages the hold in one move. (TrafficInspector is deliberately different:
 * opening a row there is a SELECTION that renders a separate detail pane, so
 * scrolling the list cannot move what is being read.)
