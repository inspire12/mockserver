"""Validate every example in the generated Postman collection against a live MockServer.

Walks examples/postman/MockServer.postman_collection.json and fires each request at a
running MockServer, asserting the example body is ACCEPTED (i.e. not a malformed-request
rejection). A 400/415/500 means the example body is wrong and fails the run. State-dependent
codes (404/406/409) still prove the body parsed, so they pass. Binary uploads, the
server-stopping /stop call, and not-on-classpath 501s are skipped (logged, never hidden).

    python3 scripts/collections/test_collections.py                 # starts a Docker MockServer
    python3 scripts/collections/test_collections.py --base-url URL  # use an already-running server

Exit 0 if all examples are accepted; 1 otherwise.

# Examples that are KNOWN to be rejected today. This is a ratchet, not an exemption list: the gate
# stays green on these so it can be wired into CI now and catch any NEW broken example, while these
# remain visible in the output as KNOWN-FAIL and are expected to shrink to nothing.
#
# Two rules keep this from decaying into a place where breakage hides:
#   1. An entry that STOPS failing fails the run ("unexpectedly passing"), so the list cannot silently
#      outlive the bug it documents — you are forced to delete the entry.
#   2. Every entry carries a reason. An entry without one is drift wearing an exemption.
#
# This list is now EMPTY, and the ratchet's first rule keeps it that way: an entry that stops
# failing fails the run, so nothing can be parked here and forgotten. Every example the collection
# publishes is accepted by a default container.
#
# The five entries that used to sit here were each a real defect, and each was fixed rather than
# excused:
#   - /mockserver/graphql            application/graphql was not in MediaType.isString(), so the SDL
#                                    arrived base64-encoded (same for application/yaml)
#   - /mockserver/asyncapi/http      the OpenAPI spec declared no requestBody example at all, so the
#                                    generated collection sent an empty body
#   - .../generateFromOpenAPI        the example fetched its spec from a URL; it is now inline, so the
#                                    published example works without egress
#   - /mockserver/verifySLO          a disabled feature answered 400 (malformed body) instead of 403
#   - .../generateFromRecording      an empty event log answered 400 (malformed body) instead of 409;
#                                    the body was always well-formed, only the state was missing, and
#                                    a state code is one the gate already accepts
#
# Adding an entry here is a last resort. Prefer fixing the example or the handler: four of the five
# above looked like "the example cannot work in a bare container" and were nothing of the sort.
