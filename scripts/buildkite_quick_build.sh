# artifact (pipeline-java.yml) and consumed by java-docker-push-snapshot.sh to build

# The guard scans compiled .class output across EVERY reactor module to prove no
# enforcement site reads a configuration value only from the static
# ConfigurationProperties store (such a read is unreachable from
# PUT /mockserver/configuration even though the value round-trips through the DTO).
# Because it scans built classes, its coverage is only complete once the WHOLE
# reactor has been compiled — and under `-T 1C` netty's own test phase runs long
# before the modules downstream of it (junit-rule, junit-jupiter, spring, async,
# blob-*, state-infinispan, testcontainers, k8s-webhook) are built. Running it in
# netty's test phase therefore silently scanned only a subset; it is excluded from
# that phase (mockserver-netty/pom.xml) and run HERE instead, after the reactor
# `clean install` above has populated every module's target/classes in this same
# container. The test itself asserts every module it SHOULD cover was actually
# scanned, so an incomplete tree fails loudly rather than narrowing scope silently.
#
# Only run it when the reactor build passed (a failed build is already red), and
# fold its exit into MVN_EXIT so a guard violation turns the whole build red.
# (still inside the `set +e` region opened before the reactor build above, so a
# guard failure is captured in GUARD_EXIT rather than aborting the script.)

# (mockserver/pom.xml) so that /mockserver is a self-contained Maven directory:
# a module path that escaped Dependabot's directory:"/mockserver" scope made
# Dependabot abort EVERY grouped core update with "No pom.xml!". The examples
# must still stay compiled AND tested, so they are built here — in the SAME
# container, immediately after the reactor `install` that populated ~/.m2 with
# the SNAPSHOT artifacts they depend on (mockserver-netty-no-dependencies,
# mockserver-client-java-no-dependencies, mockserver-testing) and the parent POM
# they inherit (../../mockserver/pom.xml). This ordering guarantee is exactly why
# the invocation lives here rather than in a separate Buildkite step, which would
# not share this container's freshly-installed local repo.
#
# Only build the examples when the reactor build itself passed, and fold the
# examples exit code into MVN_EXIT so an examples compile/test break turns the
