# Release-preflight PERFORMANCE gate for MockServer.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A release must not publish on top of a known, unreviewed performance
#   regression, and must not publish "blind" on top of code no perf run has ever
#   measured. The daily perf pipeline already stores every valid run in S3
#   (s3://<bucket>/runs/<branch>/<iso>__<sha>.json) and the committed, reviewed
#   budgets live in mockserver-performance-test/perf-budgets.json. This gate reads
#   the newest successful run for the release branch and the budget file, and
#   refuses the release when the performance picture is stale, invalid, or in an
#   unaccepted gating-budget breach.
#
# THE 8.0.0 LESSON THIS FOLLOWS
#   8.0.0 half-published because a check confirmed a credential *existed* without
#   proving it could *authenticate*, and a state that could not be proven was
#   reported as a pass. This gate applies the same grading discipline as its
#   sibling scripts/release/check-release-credentials.sh: existence != validity !=
#   capability, and an UNPROVABLE state is its own loud outcome, NEVER a green pass.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (against the newest successful run for the branch)
#   1. VALIDITY   the run's own `.validity.valid` must be true. A run that could
#                 not measure anything trustworthy is not evidence.
#   2. RECENCY    keyed off GIT ANCESTRY, not wall-clock object age. The daily
#                 producer is COMMIT-GATED (it writes no new object when master
#                 has not moved), so object age cries wolf on a quiet master — the
#                 exact trap the sibling baseline-freshness watchdog documents. So
#                 instead: the run's `.commit` must be an ancestor-or-equal of the
#                 release commit. Equal => this exact code was measured (CURRENT).
#                 A proper ancestor => the release contains N commits no perf run
#                 measured (STALE, blocks; remedy: run perf on the release commit,
#                 or record an acceptance). Not an ancestor => the newest run is on
#                 a different history than the release (DIVERGENT, blocks).
#   3. BUDGETS    for every budget marked `gating:true` in perf-budgets.json:
#                 - ABSOLUTE-floored gating budgets are evaluated DIRECTLY against
#                   this run's value (today: forward.error_rate). A breach BLOCKS
#                   unless an acceptance record covers it. A gating metric that is
#                   absent from the run (e.g. the forward guard did not run) is
#                   INDETERMINATE (fail-closed), never skipped.
#                 - RELATIVE-only gating budgets (floor:null, e.g. microbench.*
#                   time/alloc per op) CANNOT be judged from a single run — they
#                   need the rolling baseline the daily compare step owns. This gate
#                   does NOT recompute that math (it belongs to perf-test-compare.sh);
#                   it reports them as a DELEGATED SEAM and says who covers them,
#                   rather than passing them silently. See "RESIDUAL SEAM" below.
#                 - premerge_alloc.* gating budgets are per-MERGE (perf-alloc-gate.sh)
#                   and are structurally not part of a daily run object, so they are
#                   explicitly out of scope here (reported as such, not a finding).
#
# BLOCKING vs ADVISORY — DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED
#   The blocking set is read from the budget file's own `gating` field. Only
#   `gating:true` budgets can block; a `gating:false` / gating-absent budget is
#   notify-only (it has not yet earned a history-derived budget — the programme's
#   "10 runs before a budget" rule) and is NEVER consulted for a release block.
#   The gate cannot be "wrong to block on a notify-only metric" because it reads
#   the same source of truth the daily compare step does.
#
# RESIDUAL SEAM (stated, not hidden — the 8.0.0 discipline)
#   A RELATIVE gating regression (a microbench time/alloc slowdown vs baseline)
#   is not visible from a single S3 object, so this gate does not evaluate it.
#   Coverage for that class is: (a) the daily perf-test-compare.sh exits non-zero
#   on such a regression, turning the daily build red; (b) the baseline-freshness
#   watchdog (pipeline-infra.yml) fails unless the daily producer's last completed
#   scheduled build PASSED; and (c) this gate's RECENCY check blocks a release whose
#   commit the newest run never measured. This gate deliberately reads only S3 +
#   the budget file (no Buildkite API, no baseline recompute) to stay simple and
#   locally runnable; the seam is recorded here rather than papered over.
#
# OUTCOMES, KEPT DISTINCT (this is the whole point)
#   PASS         valid + current-or-not-stale + no unaccepted gating breach
#   INVALID      newest run's validity is false/absent          (finding)
#   STALE        newest run measured a proper ancestor of the release commit;
#                the release contains commits never measured    (finding)
#   DIVERGENT    newest run's commit is not an ancestor of the release commit
#                (measured a different line of development)      (finding)
#   BREACH       a gating ABSOLUTE budget is breached, unaccepted (finding)
#   NO_HISTORY   no perf runs exist for the branch at all        (finding)
#   MALFORMED    the newest run object is unparseable / missing required fields
#   INDETERMINATE a gating metric could not be evaluated, git ancestry could not
#                be resolved, or the budget file is missing/corrupt (fail-closed)
#   S3_DENIED    an AWS session exists but the bucket could not be listed
#   NO_SESSION   no usable AWS session, so nothing could be read
#
# EXIT CODES (aligned with scripts/release/check-release-credentials.sh)
#   0  PASS
#   1  a FINDING — INVALID / STALE / DIVERGENT / BREACH / NO_HISTORY
