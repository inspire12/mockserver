# Optimisation Safety

**A performance PR whose only evidence is a faster number must not merge.** A benchmark is the
motivation for a change, never its verification.

An optimisation arrives with a success signal already attached — a chart showing it worked.
That signal ends scrutiny. A feature change lands with no green light and attracts scrutiny
until it earns one. The asymmetry is structural, and the repo has paid for it:
`Http2FlowControlBodies` records in its javadoc that **four HTTP/2 defects — #2641, #2667,
#2669, #2683 — all shipped while every HTTP/2 test was green**, because every test used a body
smaller than the 65,535-byte flow-control window. The failure mode was a silent hang.

## The Data Plane Wins Ties

**When a change trades data-plane cost for control-plane gain, the data plane wins unless the case
for the reverse is very compelling.** Serving a mocked response is what MockServer is for and what
it does millions of times; the control plane is what a suite touches between tests. A millisecond
added to every request to save ten from a teardown is a bad trade even though both numbers moved in
a direction a benchmark would applaud.

This is a tie-breaker, not a veto. A control-plane change that costs the data plane nothing needs no
argument. One that costs it something needs the cost stated in the PR, measured rather than
asserted, and a reason the exchange rate is favourable — and "the control plane got much faster" is
not that reason on its own.

**Where the trade hides.** It is rarely a line that says "slow down the data plane". It is usually a
SHARED STRUCTURE that the control plane wants indexed and the data plane has to maintain. Ask: what
does this add to the per-request path, and what does it add to every mutation? Then ask the question
that catches the subtle case — **is that mutation path actually control-plane-only?** In this
codebase it is not: `firstMatchingExpectation` schedules lazy removal of `once()` and
limited-`Times` matchers during its own scan, so the SERVING path mutates the store. Anything
maintained per-mutation is therefore partly paid by the data plane, however control-plane the
feature sounds.

*Worked example, applied to this repo's own change.* The `clear` fast path (`4cda4041f`) is a
control-plane optimisation: it made `clear` O(1)-ish instead of O(n), worth 1,585 us -> 0.2 us at
15,000 expectations. It paid for that with a SECOND index dimension maintained on every structural
mutation. Under this principle that is exactly the shape to scrutinise, and the verdict is that it
passes — but the reasoning, not the conclusion, is the point:

- data-plane READS are untouched: the matching path reads the `(method, path)` buckets and the
  fallthrough, never the path-only dimension;
- the added maintenance is O(1) per mutation, not O(n);
- but it is NOT free to the data plane, because of the lazy-removal path above — a workload using
  `once()` expectations mutates the store from the serving thread and now does marginally more work
  there.

So the honest statement is "a small constant added to data-plane-triggered mutations, buying three
orders of magnitude on a control-plane operation" — not "free". It was shipped before this principle
was written down; it is recorded here because a worked example that judges our own change is worth
more than an invented one.

## The Evidence Standard

Three checks, in order. The second is the one that gets skipped.

**1. `mvn verify` passes on the affected module — not `mvn test`.** `mvn test` excludes
integration tests: surefire carries `<exclude>**/*IntegrationTest.java</exclude>` and failsafe
picks them up under `verify`. For `mockserver-netty` this is roughly 1,219 tests under `test`
against 2,275 under `verify` (measured 2026-09-16). A perf change verified with `mvn test` has
skipped nearly half the suite and essentially all tests that drive a real socket. **"Tests pass"
is not a claim; "`mvn verify` passes on `mockserver-netty`" is.**

**2. Identical inputs produce identical outputs through the old and new path.** Not "the tests
still pass" — "the output is the same." Compare byte-for-byte: response bytes, header order,
status, trailers, observable frame boundaries, the serialised event-log entry. This is the only
evidence that catches drift nobody anticipated. Where a true A/B is impractical, pin a golden
corpus before the change and diff it after.

**3. Confirm the correctness test can catch the break.** Invert the usual discipline: the fix
is the optimisation, so deliberately introduce the hazard — skip an invalidation, drop a
`release()`, reuse a buffer without clearing, remove the type guard — and confirm something goes
red. A test that cannot fail does not provide evidence; it provides false confidence.

## Hazard Classes

Every class below has occurred in this repository.

| # | Hazard | Why it evades a benchmark | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reuse and pooling** | Cross-request contamination requires concurrency; throughput is indifferent to whose bytes came back. A security failure, not only a correctness one | Concurrency test with distinguishable per-request payloads asserting zero cross-talk, at real concurrency |
| 2 | **Caching** | A cache is fastest and most wrong when it never invalidates. Hit-path tests get faster; staleness is invisible | The invalidation path tested: mutate the underlying data, assert the cached view updates. A cache tested only for hits is a bug with a benchmark attached |
| 3 | **Reference counting** | A leak shows as heap growth over hours; a double-release as corruption under load | `mvn verify` on `mockserver-netty` with leak detection at `paranoid` — wired since `a1158a104`, which found a shipped production leak on its first run. Until the flags moved to `mockserver.leakArgLine` only a plain local run was gated: CI's `-Dmockserver.testArgLine` replaced them |
| 4 | **Laziness and init order** | Cold start is single-threaded; the race needs concurrent first use. The dynamic CA race presented as a ~10% launcher flake and was a shipped TLS race | Concurrent first-use, repeated. Treat an intermittent failure introduced by a lazy-init change as a shipped race until proven otherwise |
| 5 | **Concurrency and pool changes** | A deadlock under recursion is invisible to a load generator that never recurses | The deadlock argument stated in the PR, plus a test under contention. `localCallbackExecutor` is deliberately unbounded because a bounded pool self-deadlocks on a blocking loopback callback — the javadoc is all that stands between the next optimiser and that bug |
| 6 | **Topology changes** | Handlers attached to the wrong thing still forward traffic; throughput is unaffected | Assertions on the **type**, and both parent and child cases. See note below |

A seventh hazard specific to MockServer: **init-order changes alter heap-derived capacities.**
`maxLogEntries` and `maxExpectations` derive from free heap at call time, so an optimisation
that moves *when* initialisation happens changes store sizes without touching store code. Assert
the derived capacities, not just behaviour that happens to fit inside them.

### Worked example: topology change (hazard class 6)

The HTTP/2 multiplex migration (issue #2669, `docs/code/netty-pipeline.md`) is the definitive
example for hazard class 6. Every HTTP/2 test passed before the fix; every test after ran on
per-stream `Http2StreamChannel` child channels rather than the connection channel. The
correctness test used:

- `Http2FlowControlBodies.body(OVER_WINDOW, marker)` — a body > 65,535 bytes, which crosses the
  HTTP/2 flow-control window. Every pre-fix test used a body smaller than the window; smaller
  bodies never triggered the flush path and the failure mode was a silent hang, not a wrong
  answer.
- Guard on `Http2StreamChannel` **type**, not `parent() != null`. On an HTTP/1.1 socket,
  `parent()` is the server *listening* socket; a guard written as `parent() != null` would shut
  down the entire server on the first concurrent stream, benchmarks cleanly on one connection,
  and look correct in review.

`Http2FlowControlBodies` (in `mockserver-testing`) exposes named sizes — `SMALL`, `OVER_WINDOW`
(256 KB), `LARGE` (~1 MB) — and stamps the body with a caller-supplied marker so a mis-routed or
truncated body fails an equality assertion, not a length check. Its static initialiser fails the
build if `OVER_WINDOW` is shrunk to at or below 65,535 bytes, so the blind spot cannot be
silently reintroduced.

## The Benchmark-Shaped Correctness Loss

An optimisation can be **correct on the benchmark's inputs and wrong on real ones**, because
benchmark fixtures are chosen for convenience and stability — the two properties that make them
unrepresentative:

- Sub-window bodies hid the flush family for four releases.
- All-ASCII fixtures hid a double-encoding defect.
- A 7-byte payload left frame-length bytes at zero, indistinguishable from default init.
- A new assertion pinning the proxy-auth encoder against its predecessor
  passed against a deliberately wrong encoder, because the ASCII test credential's base64
  contained no `+` or `/` — the only two characters where the standard and URL-safe alphabets
  differ. The fixture could not distinguish the two encoders it existed to distinguish. Only
  the degrade test (hazard check 3, above) found it.

The corpus must be **adversarial in exactly the dimensions the change touches**. Buffering or
flushing: cross buffer and flow-control boundaries. Encoding: non-ASCII, including the
characters where alphabets differ. Framing: empty, one-byte, boundary-minus-one, boundary,
boundary-plus-one, maximal. And the error paths — an optimisation that skips work on success
frequently skips cleanup on failure.

## A Performance Change That Removes Waiting Is a Concurrency Change

This recurred multiple times during the performance programme and is worth stating separately.

Fixed sleeps, poll granularity, and "quiet periods" in the test suite routinely compensate for
races nobody has written down. An optimisation that:
- removes or shortens a sleep,
- changes a polling interval,
- moves work to a different thread pool,
- reorders initialisation,
- or reduces how long a lock is held

...is a concurrency change. The race it exposes may have been latent for years and never
appeared because the original code was slow enough that the timing window never opened in
practice.

**Protocol**: treat any intermittent failure introduced by a performance change as evidence of a
real race, not test flakiness. Isolate the failure by bisect to the specific commit before
theorising about mechanism.

## Is This Number Measuring What You Think? — a pre-registration checklist

**The evidence standard above asks whether a change broke correctness. This asks a different and
more frequently-failed question: whether the number you are about to trust is a number OF the thing
you believe it is.** Every failure below was an instrument that RAN, PASSED, and reported an honest
figure about the wrong subject. None was a lie; each was a measurement of something adjacent.

Answer these four before quoting a performance number. They cost a minute and have a documented hit
rate.

**1. What is this a number OF?** Name the subject in one sentence, then check the instrument actually
touches it.
- `peak_achieved_rps` (now renamed `rig_valid_peak_achieved_rps`) was documented as tracking the server's ceiling. It is `max(achieved)` over
  rig-VALID rungs, so it is structurally capped at whichever rung the CLIENT stops being clean — a
  property of the rig. Build 325: server achieved 28,377 rps; the field read 2,000.1.
- A dashboard measurement reported zero long tasks and a DOM frozen at exactly 218 elements. It was
  measuring the WELCOME SCREEN, not the dashboard.

**2. What would make it lie, and can you tell from the output?** Prefer a failure that is loud over
one that looks like a pass.
- A churn benchmark's `writerMutations` counter counted LOOP ITERATIONS, so it climbed identically
  whether or not `clear(id)` still removed anything. It could not distinguish churning from spinning
  — the one thing it was cited to prove.
- Every UI bench arm discarded its result, so V8 eliminated the work. The warm arm reported
  **0.0377 ms** against a real 4.12 ms: a 140x fiction, and it read as the FASTEST number in the
  table.

**3. Degrade it and confirm red.** Break the thing the number is about and watch the number move. If
it does not, the instrument is not attached.
- A `perf-renderCount` test drove a COPY of the store's reconcile function living under `__bench__/`,
  so it would have stayed green through any regression in the real store.
- Deleting one `BODY_PARSE_CACHE.remove()` left every test green, because the guard it protected had
  no test. It was reported as "cannot be degrade-tested"; it could, and now is.

**4. Is the regime the one you care about?** A number taken where the resource is free says nothing
about the case where it is scarce.
- "Does an open dashboard cost the server anything?" measured against an IDLE server answers no, by
  construction — there is spare CPU, so background work is free. Under concurrent load the same
  question had a visible answer.
- A per-core ladder's `healthy_ceiling_rps` can only take a RUNG's value, so a doubling ladder
  carries factor-of-two uncertainty. Build 358 read 4,000 and looked like a flat server curve;
  a finer ladder measured 6,000.

**Two shapes worth knowing by name.**

*The count that did not move.* Adding tests and seeing the total stay put means they did not run.
`surefire:test` alone executes STALE classes — it does not bind `test-compile` — and reports a
confident `BUILD SUCCESS` for code you no longer have. Read the COUNT, not the verdict.

*The loose bound that hid a flake.* A work-reduction assertion of `< 500` passed three runs and
failed a fourth at 2,211. The code was fine — 2,211 was about 11 x 201, an instance-scoped counter
summing roughly eleven background scans. An EXACT assertion (201) both fixed the flake and caught a
degrade the loose one let through. Loose bounds do not make a test robust; they make it blind.

## A Planned Item Is a Hypothesis, Not a Fact

**Verify the premise before implementing it.** A written plan row ages against a moving
repository, and the row that is wrong costs more than the row that is missing — you build
something that does not help, or you "fix" behaviour that was deliberate.

This is not a theoretical risk. Two separate exercises measured it:

- A test-coverage audit found **a quarter of its twelve rows had stale premises within a day
  of being written from a careful re-audit** — one item was already wired up, one was already
  implemented and documented, one named the wrong pipeline.
- A performance programme audited its five remaining units and found **three premises stale or
  wrong**: a "response write path" whose named files were already optimal; a "template is
  re-parsed per request" row that three earlier commits had already fixed; and a
  "deduplicate the repeated parses" row whose parses each fed a *different* output field. Two
  further rows named the wrong retainer for the object they were hunting — one of them had been
  recorded as "positively ruled out" and was in fact the cause.

In every case the staleness was found by the work verifying its own premise first. So:

- **State what you expect to find, then confirm it in the code before changing anything.** If
  the premise fails, record that as the outcome — a row closed with evidence is progress.
- **Check the row against commits since it was written.** Name the commits you checked.
- **A decline with reasons is a deliverable.** Write down why, or it will be re-proposed.

**Severity labels do not predict value.** In the coverage audit the most valuable find was
rated MEDIUM: two published client libraries whose CI passed having started no container, one
of which mounted the Docker socket and then excluded the Docker tests. Wiring it up exposed
four further defects, every one caught by the new guard failing closed rather than by anything
passing.

**Absence of a failing test is not absence of a bug.** The same programme found a
secrets-redaction gap that had shipped because the redaction tests asserted on the redacted
field and never on the two neighbouring fields that carried the same data unredacted. When a
defect is found, add the assertion whose absence let it through — not only the fix.

### Log-level guards and diff coverage

Wrapping a `logEvent(new LogEntry()...)` call in an `if (isEnabled(LEVEL))` guard is correct for the hot path — it avoids the allocation. A side-effect is that the guarded body changes status in the diff-coverage gate from covered (statement executed and discarded inside `logEvent`) to uncovered (statement never reached). Recording the now-uncovered lines in `.buildkite/diff-coverage-ledger.json` appears harmless but creates a latent break: the ledger's staleness ratchet fails the build the moment any other test covers those lines (e.g., a suite that runs at `DEBUG`). The safe options are either to accept the coverage gap (the gate is notify-only and the trade is explicit) or to add a test that exercises the code path at a level where the guard is false.

### Declined optimisations — do not re-propose

The following units were investigated and declined with documented reasons. Re-opening them
without new evidence wastes a review cycle.

| Unit | What it would change | Why declined |
|------|----------------------|--------------|
| 16 — drop the `readTree` in INFO log serialisation | Stop re-parsing the body when a served request is logged | Not redundant: `new LogEntryBody(OBJECT_MAPPER.readTree(...))` produces the pretty-printed JSON the log line renders, and the two parses feed two different log lines. Removing it turns `LogEntryDeferredArgumentConversionTest` red |
| 16b — deduplicate the four body parses per `LogEntrySerializer.serialize` | Parse the body once per serialise | Each parse feeds a different occurrence in the emitted JSON (`httpRequest` redacted, `arguments[i]` unredacted, `expectation.httpRequest`, the escaped copy in `message`); repeated parses are repeated output. Only hoisting one shared `getArguments()` is safe |
| 14a — remove the per-PUT `CompletableFuture` in `HttpState` | Save one allocation per control-plane PUT | Data-plane PUTs already return before it (`isControlPlanePathCandidate` gate), and the future is load-bearing for `handleContractTest`, `handleTrafficValidate` and `handleReplay`, which block on the outbound client sharing the worker group and self-deadlock if run inline |
| 22B — cache class/object callback instances | Avoid per-request class resolution and construction | Off the measured workload. Caching the instance would share mutable user state across requests (callbacks rely on it not surviving the request); caching the `Class` needs `(classLoader, className)` weak keys to avoid a classloader leak, for a small saving |
| 18 as originally scoped — optimise `BodyDecoderEncoder.bodyToBytes` and the response header walk | Cut response-write allocation | Both were already optimal: the outbound body is zero-copy via the `rawBytes` fast path, and `ReadOnlyInsertionOrderedMultimap` reads the flat header arrays directly. Re-scoped as 18a (`ResponseWriter`) |

## Where This Plugs Into the Gate Chain

| Evidence | Where | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| `mvn verify` on affected module | Per merge, blocks the PR | The baseline — the only thing that makes "tests pass" mean anything |
| Leak detection at `paranoid` | Per merge, gated at `verify` on `mockserver-netty` | Deterministic; a leak found a week later is a bisect across a week |
| Allocation-per-op budget (`perf-alloc-gate.sh`) | Per merge | Cheap, deterministic, attributes to one commit |
| Differential corpus | Required in the landing PR as evidence, not per-merge CI | Too slow for every merge; meaningful only against the specific old path, which exists only in that PR |
| Negative control (degrade test) | Required in the landing PR | Nobody can automate "prove this test can fail"; it is a one-time act per change |
| Adversarial corpus arms | Required in the landing PR | Which dimensions matter depends on what the change touches; no CI step can infer that |
| Deadlock argument (class 5) | Required in the PR description | An argument, not a test. Writing it down stops the next person undoing it |
| Hazard-class identification; type assertions; invalidation paths | Review checklist | Judgement, not automation |
| **Measurement-validity pre-registration** (the four questions above) | **Required in the landing PR, ALONGSIDE the number** | A number is quoted the moment it exists. This has to happen before the figure is believed, not after it is disputed — and it is the cheapest item in this table |
| Daily perf run confirms the win survives | After merge | The last check, not the first |

**Two rules:**

1. **A performance PR states its hazard classes.** If the author cannot name which of the six
   apply, the change has not been understood well enough to merge. Belonging to none is
   legitimate — say so, and that is the end of it.

2. **The benchmark result belongs in the PR body under a heading saying it is motivation, not
   verification.** The failure this prevents is not that people lie about testing; it is that a
   green chart feels like completion.

3. **A quoted performance number carries its four answers.** Not a paragraph — one line each, or a
   sentence saying why a question does not apply. The documented failure rate here is high enough
   that "the benchmark said so" is not evidence on its own, and every example in that section was a
   measurement someone had already believed.
