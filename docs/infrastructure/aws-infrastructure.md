### Resource Inventory

#### Compute

| Resource | Details |
|----------|---------|
| ASG `default` | Min 0, Max 10, 60% on-demand / 40% Spot, instance types m7i/m6a/m6i/m7a.2xlarge (all 8 vCPU / 32 GiB, x86_64; on-demand on m7i), on-demand base capacity 1, 1 agent/instance, AZRebalance suspended |
| ASG `trigger` | Min 0, Max 4, 100% Spot, t3.small/t3a.small/t3.micro, 4 agents/instance — cheap instances for trigger polling jobs |
| ASG `release` | Min 0, Max 2, 100% on-demand, same instance types as default (so it runs on the first one, m7i.2xlarge), 1 agent/instance |
| ASG `perf` | Min 0, Max 3, 100% on-demand, c5.12xlarge, on-demand base 0, 1 agent/instance — scale-to-zero; up to three concurrent perf jobs, each on its own machine |
| ASG `perf-xl` | Min 0, Max 1, 100% on-demand, c6i.32xlarge, on-demand base 0, 1 agent/instance — scale-to-zero; one large perf job at a time |
| Launch Template | m7i.2xlarge (primary for default/release), t3.small (primary for trigger), 250 GiB gp3 root volume, delete-on-termination |
| EC2 Instances | 0–10 default + 0–4 trigger + 0–2 release + 0–3 perf + 0–1 perf-xl (ephemeral), all scale to zero when idle |

#### Networking

| Resource | Details |
|----------|---------|
| VPC | `10.0.0.0/16` |
| Subnets | `10.0.1.0/24` (eu-west-2a), `10.0.2.0/24` (eu-west-2b), both public |
| Internet Gateway | Attached to Buildkite VPC |
| Route Table | Public: local + default to IGW |
| Security Group (agents) | Agent traffic, no inbound rules |
| Security Group (VPC endpoints) | HTTPS (443) from VPC CIDR only |
| VPC Endpoints | SSM, SSM Messages, EC2 Messages (Interface type) |

#### Lambda

| Function | Runtime | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Scaler | `provided.al2023` | Scales ASG based on Buildkite queue depth |
| AZ Rebalance Suspender | `python3.13` | Suspends AZRebalance on the ASG |

#### EventBridge

| Schedule | Target |
|----------|--------|
| `rate(1 minute)` | Scaler Lambda |

#### Storage

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| S3 Bucket (state) | Terraform state (versioned, encrypted, public access blocked) |
| S3 Bucket (secrets) | Buildkite managed secrets (versioned, encrypted, public access blocked) |
| S3 Bucket (secrets logs) | Secrets bucket access logs (versioned, encrypted, public access blocked) |
| S3 Bucket (CloudTrail) | CloudTrail audit logs (encrypted, 90-day lifecycle, public access blocked) |
| S3 Bucket (dependency cache) | CI dependency cache for Maven/npm/pip/Bundler (encrypted, 14-day lifecycle, public access blocked) — requires `terraform apply` to create; pipeline cache scripts no-op gracefully until bucket exists |
| S3 Bucket (`mockserver-ci-perf-results`) | Performance regression run history — one JSON per run under `runs/<branch>/<iso>__<sha>.json` (versioning enabled, current versions retained indefinitely, noncurrent expire after 365d, AES256, public access blocked) |

#### Container Registry

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| ECR Public Repository (`mockserver`) | Public Docker image registry at `public.ecr.aws/t2x9c0i6/mockserver` (`t2x9c0i6` is the AWS-assigned registry alias) — avoids Docker Hub rate limits for AWS-based CI/CD |
| ECR Pull-Through Cache rules (`docker-hub`, `quay`) | Private regional cache (eu-west-2) for the Testcontainers backing images. CI pulls in-region; the upstreams (Docker Hub, quay.io) are contacted only on a first miss. **`mcr.microsoft.com` is NOT supported by ECR pull-through** (`UnsupportedUpstreamRegistryException`), so azurite pulls direct from Microsoft — the host pre-pull is its only guard. Applied 2026 (agent stack now elastic-ci-stack v6.71.3). Auto-created cache repos get AES256 + a 30-day expiry via a repository creation template |

#### Secrets

| Resource | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| SSM Parameter | SecureString | Buildkite agent registration token |
| Secrets Manager Secret (`mockserver-build/dockerhub`) | JSON | Docker Hub credentials for CI image push (JSON keys `username`/`token`) |
| Secrets Manager Secret (`ecr-pullthroughcache/dockerhub`) | JSON | Docker Hub credentials for the ECR pull-through cache. Separate secret because ECR mandates the `ecr-pullthroughcache/` name prefix and JSON keys `username`/`accessToken` — the push secret above cannot be reused. Value set out of band |
| Secrets Manager Secret (`mockserver-build/buildkite-api-token`) | String | Buildkite API token for Terraform pipeline management |

#### CloudWatch Log Groups (eu-west-2)

| Log Group | Retention | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Scaler Lambda | 1 day | Scaler Lambda logs |
| AZ Rebalance Suspender Lambda | 30 days | AZ rebalance suspender logs |
| `/buildkite/auth` | 30 days | Agent auth logs |
| `/buildkite/buildkite-agent` | 30 days | Agent logs |
| `/buildkite/cloud-init` | 30 days | Instance bootstrap logs |
| `/buildkite/cloud-init/output` | 30 days | Instance bootstrap output |
| `/buildkite/docker-daemon` | 30 days | Docker daemon logs |
| `/buildkite/elastic-stack` | 30 days | Elastic stack logs |
| `/buildkite/lifecycled` | 30 days | Instance lifecycle logs |
| `/buildkite/system` | 30 days | System logs |

#### IAM

Policies are scoped per queue — each agent role receives only the secrets and permissions it actually uses.

| Resource | Purpose | Attached to |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| EC2 Instance Role | Buildkite agent permissions (SSM, S3 secrets, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch) | all queues |
| Scaler Lambda Role | ASG scaling + CloudWatch Logs | Lambda |
| AZ Rebalance Suspender Role | ASG process management | Lambda |
| Instance Profile | Attached to EC2 instances | all queues |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-read-buildkite-api-token`) | Allows agents to read the Buildkite API token from Secrets Manager | trigger, perf |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-read-dockerhub-secret`) | Allows agents to read Docker Hub credentials from Secrets Manager | default, release |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-read-build-secrets-default`) | Allows default-queue agents to read buildkite-api-token + sonatype from Secrets Manager | default |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-read-build-secrets-release`) | Allows release-queue agents to read buildkite-api-token + sonatype + pypi + rubygems from Secrets Manager | release |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-read-release-secrets`) | Allows release agents to read GPG, GitHub, npm, SwaggerHub, website-role secrets + cross-account sts:AssumeRole | release |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-ecr-public-push`) | Allows agents to push Docker images to ECR Public | default, release |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-ecr-pull-through`) | Allows agents to pull CI Testcontainers images through the ECR pull-through cache and trigger first-miss imports (scoped to the `docker-hub/*` and `quay/*` cache repos; no `mcr/*` — mcr.microsoft.com is not a supported upstream) | default, release |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-dependency-cache`) | Allows agents to read/write the CI dependency cache S3 bucket — DETACHED (runtime wiring reverted; re-attach when cache integrity is implemented) | none |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-perf-results`) | Allows perf-queue agents to Get/Put/List objects in `mockserver-ci-perf-results` | perf, perf-xl |
| IAM Policy (`buildkite-release-website-tfstate`) | Allows release agents to read/write website Terraform state and lock file | release |
| Service-linked roles | AutoScaling, EC2Spot, Organizations, SSO, Support, TrustedAdvisor, ResourceExplorer, ECR Pull-Through Cache (`AWSServiceRoleForECRPullThroughCache` — reads the upstream credential secret + creates cache repos; managed in `ecr-pull-through-cache.tf`, import if it already exists) | account |

#### Security

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Account-level S3 public access block | Enabled (all 4 flags) |
| CloudTrail | `mockserver-management-trail` — multi-region, log file validation, KMS-encrypted; management events (incl. Secrets Manager access) + S3 data events on the tfstate bucket |
| GuardDuty | Enabled with S3 data events; HIGH/CRITICAL findings alert via EventBridge -> SNS |
| Access Analyzer | Account-level analyzer enabled |
| VPC flow logs | ALL traffic logged to CloudWatch on all 5 VPCs (default, trigger, release, perf, perf-xl). perf-xl's flow log is keyed by stack name (`agent_vpc_ids_by_stack` in `security-hardening.tf`) so it plans before its VPC exists |
| SNS encryption | `alias/aws/sns` KMS encryption on alerts topic |
| State bucket encryption | KMS CMK (`alias/mockserver-terraform-state`) with key rotation |
| Config bucket encryption | KMS CMK (shared with CloudTrail) |
| Root MFA | Enabled |
| IAM users | None (SSO-only access) |
| Password policy | Not set (no IAM users exist) |

### Scaling Behaviour

#### Default Queue (builds)
- **Minimum:** 0 instances (scales to zero when idle)
- **Maximum:** 10 instances, 1 agent per instance
- **Instance types:** `m7i.2xlarge,m6a.2xlarge,m6i.2xlarge,m7a.2xlarge`, all 8 vCPU / 32 GiB and x86_64 (see "Choosing the default-queue instance types" below)
- **Capacity mix:** 60% on-demand, 40% Spot, with on-demand base capacity of 1 (raised from 20% on-demand after Spot reclamations were killing long Maven builds; see CI/CD doc)
- **Build cost:** about $0.47/hr per on-demand agent (m7i.2xlarge) and $0.16–0.21/hr per Spot agent, eu-west-2 Linux list prices

#### Choosing the default-queue instance types

The type ORDER only steers on-demand capacity. On-demand uses the `prioritized` strategy, so it launches the first type in `instance_types` and moves down the list only when that type has no capacity. The release queue is 100% on-demand on the same list, so it runs on the first type too. Spot uses `capacity-optimized`, which picks whichever listed pool has the most spare capacity and ignores the order. **A type that is too slow must therefore be removed, not moved to the end**, or Spot keeps landing on it.

The `:maven: build` step is long enough that the agent type changes its duration by minutes. On the same commits (October 2026), m6a.2xlarge finished the step about 17% faster than m5.2xlarge, and an m5a.2xlarge build was slow enough to hit the 90-minute step timeout. m5, m5a and m5n were removed for that reason; m5n.2xlarge is not offered in eu-west-2 at all.

| Type | CPU | vCPU / physical cores / GiB | On-demand $/hr (eu-west-2) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| m7i.2xlarge | Intel Sapphire Rapids | 8 / 4 / 32 | 0.466 | First: all on-demand and release capacity |
| m6a.2xlarge | AMD Milan | 8 / 4 / 32 | 0.400 | On-demand fallback, Spot |
| m6i.2xlarge | Intel Ice Lake | 8 / 4 / 32 | 0.444 | On-demand fallback, Spot |
| m7a.2xlarge | AMD Genoa | 8 / 8 / 32 | 0.536 | Spot (no SMT: 8 vCPU are 8 physical cores) |
| m5.2xlarge (removed) | Intel Skylake | 8 / 4 / 32 | 0.444 | — |

Keep every entry 8 vCPU / 32 GiB: the build container is limited to 12g and holds the 6g-heap Maven reactor and the dashboard build in one cgroup (see `variables.tf`), and the 8-vCPU count is what the build's thread settings and the perf gates assume. Keep the first type x86_64: the stack derives the AMI architecture from the first type's family, and a Graviton (`g`) family there would switch every agent to the arm64 AMI. Swapping m5 for m7i leaves the on-demand vCPU quota usage unchanged (8 vCPU per agent either way). Prices are Linux on-demand list prices for eu-west-2 as of October 2026; check them again before reordering. To see which type a build actually ran on, read the agent's `aws:instance-type` metadata in Buildkite.

#### Trigger Queue (polling)
- **Minimum:** 0 instances (scales to zero when idle)
- **Maximum:** 4 instances, 4 agents per instance (up to 16 concurrent trigger jobs)
- **Instance types:** t3.small, t3a.small, t3.micro
- **Capacity mix:** 100% Spot
- **Cost:** ~$0.004–0.008/hr per instance (~$0.001–0.002/hr per trigger agent)

#### Perf Queue (regression benchmarks)
- **Minimum:** 0 instances (scale-to-zero — mandatory, see AGENTS.md)
- **Maximum:** 3 instances, 1 agent per instance — up to three perf jobs run at once, and each has a whole machine to itself, so concurrent jobs never contend for CPU, memory, Docker or ports. A regression build's measurement steps (run + sample, micro-benchmark, HTTP/2 multiplex, allocation profile) spread across the agents; they share results only through Buildkite artifacts and the S3 history, never through an agent's local disk
- **Instance type:** c5.12xlarge (48 vCPU across 24 physical cores — enough to core-pin server + upstream + k6 to physically disjoint cpusets)
- **Cross-machine variance:** two jobs that run at the same time are on different VMs, and VM-to-VM variance is a few percent. The rolling baseline already spans many machines (every daily run gets a fresh one), but a close A/B comparison should measure both arms within one job on one machine, or repeat each arm
- **Capacity mix:** 100% on-demand (spot interruptions mid-benchmark would corrupt results)
- **On-demand base capacity:** 0
- **Single-AZ pinning:** not implemented (one agent per instance + a single instance type already gives strong run-to-run reproducibility)
- **Managed policies:** `read_buildkite_api_token`, `read_buildkite_api_token_readonly`, `buildkite-perf-results`, `buildkite-imds-hardening`

#### Perf-XL Queue (large benchmarks)
- **Purpose:** performance runs that need far more cores than one c5.12xlarge — the counterpart to `perf`, with the same rules
- **Minimum:** 0 instances (scale-to-zero — mandatory, see AGENTS.md)
- **Maximum:** 1 instance, 1 agent per instance
- **Instance type:** c6i.32xlarge (128 vCPU across 64 physical cores, 256 GiB, 50 Gbit/s). It is Ice Lake rather than perf's Cascade Lake, so numbers from the two queues are not comparable
- **Capacity mix:** 100% on-demand, on-demand base capacity 0
- **Managed policies:** `read_buildkite_api_token_readonly`, `buildkite-perf-results`, `buildkite-imds-hardening` (perf's set without the write API token, which nothing on the perf queues uses)
- **Cost:** $6.464/hr on-demand in eu-west-2 (AWS Pricing API, price list of 2026-09-25), billed only while a job holds the box. Like every stack, its own VPC carries three SSM interface endpoints across two subnets, about $0.066/hr (~$48/month) even at zero instances
- **vCPU quota:** shares the account's "Running On-Demand Standard" quota (384 vCPU in eu-west-2 at the time of writing) with the other on-demand queues. perf at full scale (3 × 48) plus perf-xl (128) is 272 vCPU. With the default and release queues' on-demand instances running too, the realistic peak is about 344 of 384, a margin of about 40 vCPU

#### Common
- **Scaling frequency:** Every 60 seconds
- **Scale trigger:** Buildkite job queue depth
- **Idle cost:** $0 for instances (all queues scale to zero). Each stack's VPC still pays for its three SSM interface endpoints, about $0.066/hr per stack

### Build Flow

    participant BK as Buildkite
    participant Lambda as Autoscaler Lambda
    participant ASG as AutoScaling Group
    participant Agent as EC2 Agent
    participant Docker as Docker Container

    loop Every 60 seconds
        Lambda->>BK: Check job queue depth

    end

    BK->>Agent: Job available

    Docker-->>BK: Upload artifacts (*.log)

    Note over Agent,ASG: When idle, agents self-terminate. ASG scales back to 0
```

## Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

The Buildkite agent infrastructure is managed by Terraform in `terraform/buildkite-agents/`, using the official [Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://github.com/buildkite/terraform-buildkite-elastic-ci-stack-for-aws) module.

### Module Configuration

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Terraform module | `buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws/buildkite` ~0.12.x |
| Region | `eu-west-2` |
| Instance types | m7i/m6a/m6i/m7a.2xlarge (on-demand on m7i) |
| Capacity | 60% on-demand / 40% Spot, base capacity 1 on-demand |
| Scaling | 0–10 instances |
| State backend | S3 in `eu-west-2` (native lockfile) |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch alarms, SNS email alerts, dashboard |

### State Backend

Remote state is stored in S3 with `use_lockfile = true` for S3-native file locking (`.tflock`). The state bucket is encrypted with a dedicated KMS CMK (`alias/mockserver-terraform-state`) defined in `bootstrap/main.tf` and referenced by `backend.tf` as `kms_key_id`.

**Apply ordering:** the bootstrap stack must be applied first to create the CMK. After the key exists, run `terraform init -reconfigure` on the main stack to pick up the new `kms_key_id`. Existing state objects re-encrypt on next write.

The bootstrap (`terraform/buildkite-agents/bootstrap/`) uses `import` blocks, making it idempotent — safe to re-run against existing resources.

### Variables

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|

#### Buildkite Agent Token Security

The `buildkite_agent_token` is a sensitive credential that grants agent registration. **NEVER** write it to `terraform.tfvars` (even though the file is gitignored, plaintext secrets on local disk are a risk). Supply it at apply time via environment variable:

```bash
export TF_VAR_buildkite_agent_token=$(aws ssm get-parameter \
  --name /buildkite/buildkite/agent-token \
  --with-decryption --query Parameter.Value --output text \
  --profile mockserver-build --region eu-west-2)
```

The `run.sh` wrapper does this automatically (it loads the parameter into `TF_VAR_buildkite_agent_token` before every `init`/`plan`/`apply`).

**Cluster migration:** Buildkite deprecated unclustered (organization-level) agents, so all pipelines and agents now live in the **Default cluster**. The token above is a *cluster* agent token, minted by the `terraform/buildkite-pipelines` stack (`buildkite_cluster_agent_token`) and published to the SSM SecureString `/buildkite/buildkite/agent-token`. That stack also defines the cluster queues (`default`, `trigger`, `release`, `perf`, `perf-xl`) and assigns every pipeline to the cluster via `cluster_id`. Apply order: `buildkite-pipelines` (mints token + queues) **before** `buildkite-agents` (consumes the token from SSM).

### Quick Start

```bash
# Bootstrap state backend (first time only)
./terraform/buildkite-agents/run.sh bootstrap

# Preview changes
./terraform/buildkite-agents/run.sh plan

# Apply changes
./terraform/buildkite-agents/run.sh apply
```

The `run.sh` wrapper handles AWS SSO authentication and environment workarounds (corporate TLS proxy, macOS pyexpat).

## Website Account

S3, CloudFront, Route 53 records, and the cross-account IAM role used by the release pipeline are **managed by Terraform in [`terraform/website/`](../../terraform/website/README.md)**. The IaC pieces below are summarised here; see the module README for the canonical reference, variables, and outputs.

### Architecture

    DNS["Route53
www.mock-server.com"] -->|A record alias| CF
```

### AWS Organization and SSO

The website account runs its own AWS Organization with a separate IAM Identity Center instance. This is independent from the build account's organization. Access is managed via SSO — no IAM users or long-lived credentials exist. **Manual (one-time)** — predates Terraform.

### S3 Buckets

19 S3 buckets — 1 for the current website, plus versioned archives for each MockServer major/minor release and a personal site. See `~/mockserver-aws-ids.md` for bucket names. **Managed by `terraform/website/sites.tf`** (`aws_s3_bucket.site`, `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.site`, `aws_s3_bucket_policy.site` — one of each per `sites` map entry). S3 static-website hosting (`aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration`) is not configured — CloudFront uses the OAC REST origin with `default_root_object` rather than the S3 website endpoint. Bucket *contents* are uploaded by the release pipeline (`scripts/release/components/website.sh`, `…/javadoc.sh`, `…/helm.sh`), not by Terraform.

### CloudFront Distributions

19 distributions — one per S3 bucket, each mapped to a domain alias. The main site serves `mock-server.com`, with versioned subdomains (`4-0` through `5-14`) for archived documentation. **Managed by `terraform/website/sites.tf`** (`aws_cloudfront_distribution.site` per version + `aws_cloudfront_distribution.main` for the apex).

A separate distribution serves `downloads.mock-server.com` from the private `aws-binaries-mockserver` bucket (OAC, reusing the shared WAF web ACL, response-headers policy, and access-logs bucket). **Managed by `terraform/website/binaries.tf`.** It hosts the JVM-less client binary bundles that the Go/.NET/Rust/Ruby/Python/Node launchers download for **`-SNAPSHOT`** versions; released versions are downloaded from GitHub Release assets instead (see [ci-cd.md](ci-cd.md)).

All distributions authenticate to S3 via Origin Access Control (OAC) only; the legacy Origin Access Identity (OAI) grants were removed from the bucket policies after the OAC cutover was verified. S3 buckets are not publicly accessible — only CloudFront can read objects.

Main distribution config: `PriceClass_All`, HTTP/2+3, TLSv1.2_2021 minimum, redirect HTTP→HTTPS, custom 403→404 mapping to `/error403.html`. The private (OAC) bucket returns 403 for any missing object; CloudFront serves the friendly error page but preserves a real **404** status. `error403.html` still `meta refresh`es human visitors to the homepage, so deep-link/moved-URL refreshes land somewhere useful, while search-engine crawlers receive the 404 and drop deleted URLs (old apidocs, retired path-based copies) instead of treating thousands of soft-404s as duplicate indexable pages. The main distribution `depends_on` the per-version distributions so promoting a new `latest_version` doesn't trip the CloudFront "CNAME already associated" error.

A shared CloudFront response headers policy (`mockserver-security-headers`) is attached to the default cache behaviour of both distributions. It enforces: HSTS (`max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and a conservative Content Security Policy. **Managed by `terraform/website/sites.tf`** (`aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy.security`).

### Cross-account IAM Role

The build-account Buildkite agents push releases into the website account by assuming `mockserver-release-website` via `sts:AssumeRole`. **Managed by `terraform/website/cross-account-role.tf`.** Permissions are scoped:

- S3 object and bucket verbs (`GetObject`, `PutObject`, `DeleteObject`, `ListBucket`, etc.) on `arn:aws:s3:::aws-website-mockserver-*` only — ACL and website-configuration verbs are removed (buckets use OAC + `BucketOwnerEnforced`)
- S3 bucket verbs on `arn:aws:s3:::aws-binaries-mockserver` (the `downloads.mock-server.com` bundle host, `binaries.tf`) — adds `s3:PutBucketVersioning` + `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` (the bucket enables versioning + SSE) and `s3:ListBucket` (backs the provider's `HeadBucket` probe; without it the refresh 403s and the provider misreads it as a deleted bucket, planning a destructive recreate)
- `cloudfront:*` (account-wide — CloudFront lacks resource-level permissions for distribution-list/create)
- `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets` on the `mock-server.com` hosted zone only

> **Why the release role needs the binaries bucket.** `versioned-site.sh` runs `terraform apply` over the **whole** `terraform/website/` state, so Terraform refreshes (and may create) every resource in it — including `binaries.tf`. Any resource added to that module must have a matching grant in `cross-account-role.tf` or the release's Versioned Site step fails with `AccessDenied`. The `aws-binaries-mockserver` bucket is only *written* by the SNAPSHOT bundle CI step (build-account agent, cross-account write); **released versions ship as GitHub Release assets**, not to S3. The release role manages it purely because its IaC lives in this release-applied state. This gap is exactly what failed release build #49 (binaries bucket added to the state without updating the release role).

The trust policy optionally requires `sts:ExternalId` when `var.role_external_id` is non-empty (inactive until wired — default `""`). When set, the matching value must be supplied at apply time via `TF_VAR_role_external_id` from Secrets Manager; see `terraform/website/README.md` for the wiring procedure.

### Route53 Hosted Zones

| Domain | Records | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `mock-server.com` | 26 | Main site + all versioned subdomains |
| `mock-server.org` | 4 | Redirects to `mock-server.com` via CloudFront |
| `jamesdbloom.com` | 8 | Personal site |
| `bluesquashtechnology.com` | 6 | Other domain |
| `subdomain.bluesquashtechnology.com` | 4 | Subdomain delegation |

`mock-server.com` DNS records: apex → CloudFront (main), `www` → alias to apex, `org` → alias to apex, plus 15 versioned subdomain A records (`4-0` through `5-14`) each pointing to their respective CloudFront distribution. ACM validation CNAME records for certificate renewal. CAA records (`0 issue "amazon.com"` and `0 issuewild "amazon.com"`) restrict certificate issuance to Amazon CA — managed by `terraform/website/sites.tf` (`aws_route53_record.caa`).

The hosted zone itself is **manual (one-time)** — it predates Terraform. **All A-alias records** inside it (`aws_route53_record.site` per version, `aws_route53_record.main` for apex, `aws_route53_record.www`) **are managed by `terraform/website/sites.tf`**. ACM validation CNAMEs are managed by AWS as part of the cert lifecycle.

SES email forwarding DNS records (managed by `terraform/ses-email-forwarding/`): apex MX record routing to `inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`, `_amazonses` TXT for domain verification, 3 DKIM CNAME records (`<token>._domainkey`), and `_dmarc` TXT. See [AWS SES Email Forwarding](aws-ses-email-forwarding.md) for full details.

### ACM Certificates (us-east-1)

| Domain | Expires | Renewal |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `mock-server.com` (+ `*.mock-server.com`, `org.`, `www.`) | 2026-09-17 | Eligible (auto-renew) |
| `*.mock-server.com` | 2026-09-29 | Eligible (auto-renew) |
| `blog.jamesdbloom.com` | — | Eligible |

Certificates are **not** managed by Terraform — issuance was a one-time manual request with DNS validation, and renewals are automatic. The ARN is passed into the `terraform/website/` module as `acm_certificate_arn`.

### S3 Bucket Contents

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `/` (root) | Jekyll website (`www.mock-server.com`) |
| `/versions/<version>/` | Javadoc for each release |
| `/*.tgz` + `index.yaml` | Helm chart repository |

### Website Deployment Process

1. Build Jekyll site: `bundle exec jekyll build`
2. Upload `_site/` contents to S3 bucket root
3. Invalidate CloudFront cache
4. See [Release Process](../operations/release-process.md) for full details

### Security

| Control | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Account-level S3 public access block | Enabled (all 4 flags) |
| Bucket-level S3 public access blocks | Enabled on all 19 buckets |
| CloudFront OAC | All 19 distributions use Origin Access Control — S3 not directly accessible |
| CloudFront security headers | HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy on all distributions |
| CAA records | `mock-server.com` CAA pinned to `amazon.com` — prevents rogue CA issuance |
| CloudTrail | `mockserver-website-trail` — multi-region, log file validation, 90-day retention |
| Root MFA | Enabled |
| IAM users | None (SSO-only access) |
| CloudFront TLS | TLSv1.2_2021 minimum, HTTP→HTTPS redirect |

### Monthly Cost

~$3.36/month: Route53 ($2.88 for 5 hosted zones), S3 ($0.31), CloudFront (<$0.01).

## Recommendations

No outstanding recommendations. All infrastructure is current.

## AWS CLI Operations

These commands target the Terraform-managed infrastructure in `eu-west-2`. The ASG name is dynamically generated by the Elastic CI Stack module, so look it up first:

```bash
aws sso login --profile mockserver-build

ASG_NAME=$(aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups \
  --profile mockserver-build --region eu-west-2 \
  --query 'AutoScalingGroups[?contains(Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value | [0], `buildkite`)].AutoScalingGroupName' \
  --output text)

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups \
  --auto-scaling-group-names "$ASG_NAME" \
  --region eu-west-2 --profile mockserver-build \
  --query 'AutoScalingGroups[0].{Desired:DesiredCapacity,Instances:Instances[*].{ID:InstanceId,State:LifecycleState}}'

aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:aws:autoscaling:groupName,Values=$ASG_NAME" \
  --region eu-west-2 --profile mockserver-build \
  --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].{ID:InstanceId,State:State.Name,Launch:LaunchTime}'

aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id <instance-id> \
  --region eu-west-2 --profile mockserver-build

aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity \
  --auto-scaling-group-name "$ASG_NAME" \
  --desired-capacity 4 --region eu-west-2 --profile mockserver-build
```

## AWS CLI Prerequisites

1. **Install AWS CLI:** `brew install awscli`
2. **Configure SSO profiles:** see `~/mockserver-aws-ids.md` for SSO start URLs and regions
   - `aws configure sso --profile mockserver-build`
   - `aws configure sso --profile mockserver-website`
3. **Authenticate:**
   - `aws sso login --profile mockserver-build` (or shell alias `awsl-build`)
   - `aws sso login --profile mockserver-website` (or shell alias `awsl-web`)
4. **Corporate TLS proxy:** set `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` to your corporate root CA PEM file (e.g., `export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=$NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`)
5. **macOS + Python 3.14 + Homebrew:** if `pyexpat` symbol errors occur, set `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/expat/lib`
