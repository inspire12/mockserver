# Transparent Proxy / Sidecar Mode

MockServer can run as a Kubernetes sidecar proxy with transparent HTTP interception. This enables service mesh integration patterns where MockServer intercepts traffic destined for external services.

```

## Transparent Proxy Mode

When `transparentProxyEnabled=true`, MockServer treats all incoming HTTP connections as proxy requests. Instead of requiring clients to send explicit HTTP CONNECT requests, it uses the `Host` header to determine the forwarding target.

This works with Linux iptables REDIRECT rules that redirect outbound traffic to MockServer's port, making the interception transparent to the application.

### How it works

1. iptables redirects outbound traffic from the application container to MockServer's port
2. MockServer resolves the original destination:
   - **On Linux**: reads the original destination from the kernel conntrack table (`/proc/net/nf_conntrack`) which records the pre-REDIRECT destination. This is the most accurate method and works even when the Host header is missing, wrong, or the request is non-HTTP (binary).
   - **Fallback**: if conntrack is unavailable (non-Linux OS, `nf_conntrack` module not loaded, or the entry has been flushed), MockServer falls back to the `Host` header from the incoming request.
3. If an expectation matches, MockServer returns the mock response
4. Otherwise, MockServer forwards the request to the original target

**CONNECT and SOCKS on an intercepted connection.** A client that sends a CONNECT (or SOCKS) request on an intercepted connection, for example one with `HTTPS_PROXY` pointing at the port the traffic is redirected to, gets a tunnel to MockServer itself, as on any other connection: the original destination (from the resolver chain, a PROXY protocol header or `proxyRemoteHost`) is not used for the tunnel. The requests inside it are matched against expectations and, when none matches, forwarded to the host and port the CONNECT names. (Only MockServer answers the `PROXIED_` preamble that opens a tunnel's loopback leg, so the tunnel cannot go to any other destination.) Requests that are not tunnelled are unchanged: unmatched ones still go to the original destination.

### Configuration

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `transparentProxyEnabled` | `false` | Enable transparent proxy mode |

Environment variable: `MOCKSERVER_TRANSPARENT_PROXY_ENABLED`

### iptables example (init container)

The UID-based RETURN rule **must come before** any REDIRECT rules to prevent an infinite redirect loop: when MockServer forwards a request upstream, its own outgoing packet would otherwise match the REDIRECT and loop back to itself.

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: iptables-init
    image: alpine:3.19
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
    command:
      - sh
      - -c
      - |
        # RETURN first — exclude MockServer's own egress (UID 65534) to prevent redirect loop
        iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner 65534 -j RETURN
        iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1080
        iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1080
```

The `excludeUid` must match `app.runAsUser` (default 65534). The Helm chart configures this via `sidecar.iptables.excludeUid`.

## Helm Chart

The Helm chart includes sidecar configuration under the `sidecar` key:

```yaml
sidecar:
  enabled: false
  transparentProxy: false
  iptables:
    enabled: false
    excludeUid: 65534   # must match app.runAsUser to prevent redirect loop
```

When `sidecar.transparentProxy` is true, the `MOCKSERVER_TRANSPARENT_PROXY_ENABLED` environment variable is set in the deployment.

### Automatic Sidecar Injection (Admission Webhook)

When `webhook.enabled=true`, the chart deploys a MutatingAdmissionWebhook that automatically injects the MockServer sidecar and iptables init container into pods. This removes the need to manually edit every Deployment. See [helm.md](helm.md) for full details.

The webhook Docker image (`mockserver/mockserver-webhook`) is published to Docker Hub and ECR Public by the release pipeline alongside the main MockServer image. Install with the webhook enabled:

```bash
helm install mockserver mockserver/mockserver \
  --set webhook.enabled=true
kubectl label namespace my-namespace mockserver.org/sidecar-injection=enabled
# Annotate pods: mockserver.org/inject: "true"
```

**Building locally (optional, for development):**

```bash
# Build the fat jar and Docker image
cd mockserver && ./mvnw package -pl mockserver-k8s-webhook -DskipTests && cd ..
cp mockserver/mockserver-k8s-webhook/target/mockserver-k8s-webhook-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
  docker/webhook/mockserver-webhook.jar
docker build -t mockserver/mockserver-webhook:6.1.1-SNAPSHOT docker/webhook
```

## Original-Destination Resolution

MockServer resolves the original destination of intercepted connections through a composite chain (`CompositeOriginalDestinationResolver`). Each resolver is tried in order; the first non-null result wins.

### Resolver Chain

| Priority | Resolver | Strategy | Requirements |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `TproxyOriginalDestinationResolver` | Reads `channel.localAddress()` — with TPROXY iptables rules, this IS the original destination | `transparentProxyTproxy=true`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, Netty epoll |
| 2 | `EbpfOriginalDestinationResolver` | eBPF map lookup | `transparentProxyEbpf=true` |
| 3 | `SoOriginalDstResolver` | O(1) `getsockopt(SO_ORIGINAL_DST)` via JNA (no JNI) | Linux, Netty epoll (`EpollSocketChannel`), JNA native loadable |
| 4 | `ConntrackOriginalDestinationResolver` | O(n) parse of `/proc/net/nf_conntrack` | Linux, `nf_conntrack` module loaded, file readable |
| 5 | `DnsIntentOriginalDestinationResolver` | Infers destination from DNS query history | Fallback when all above return null |

The default chain for REDIRECT-based transparent proxy is: **SO_ORIGINAL_DST → conntrack → dns-intent**. When `transparentProxyTproxy=true`, TPROXY is prepended as the first resolver.

### SO_ORIGINAL_DST (Primary Path)

`SoOriginalDstResolver` calls `getsockopt(fd, SOL_IP, SO_ORIGINAL_DST, ...)` via JNA — not JNI. JNA loads the C library dynamically at runtime, so no compile-time native code is needed. The resolver is an O(1) socket-option read and returns null (never throws) on unsupported platforms (non-Linux, NIO transport, JNA unavailable), allowing the chain to fall through.

Requirements:
- Linux OS
- Netty epoll transport (`EpollSocketChannel`) — the NIO transport does not expose a raw file descriptor
- JNA loadable at runtime (`com.sun.jna.Native`) — JNA must be **unrelocated**: `libjnidispatch` binds its JNI entry points to the `com.sun.jna` class names, so relocated JNA cannot initialise

Where JNA loads:

| Artifact | JNA | SO_ORIGINAL_DST / eBPF lookups |
|---|---|---|
| `mockserver/mockserver` images (`-graaljs`, `-clustered`, `-aot`, `-http3`) | unrelocated (built from the build-internal `mockserver-netty-docker` jar) | work on epoll |
| `mockserver-netty` jar-with-dependencies, the unshaded module | unrelocated | work on epoll |
| `mockserver-netty-no-dependencies` (library jar on Maven Central) | relocated to `shaded_package.com.sun.jna`, so it cannot clash with an embedding app's own JNA (Testcontainers, docker-java) | fall back to conntrack |

### Conntrack (Fallback)

`ConntrackOriginalDestinationResolver` parses `/proc/net/nf_conntrack` to find the pre-`iptables -j REDIRECT` destination. This is O(n) per connection (n = tracked connections), capped at 200,000 lines to bound CPU cost. If the table exceeds the cap or `nf_conntrack` is unavailable, the resolver returns null and the chain continues to dns-intent.

### TPROXY Mode

With `transparentProxyTproxy=true`, iptables uses `-j TPROXY` instead of `-j REDIRECT`. The kernel preserves the original destination as the socket's local address, so resolution is trivial (`channel.localAddress()` returns it directly). No conntrack lookup or `getsockopt` is needed.

### Testing

- Unit tests for all resolvers run cross-platform (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- `SoOriginalDstResolverTest` verifies sockaddr decoding and platform-support gating
- `TproxyOriginalDestinationResolverTest` verifies TPROXY mode flag and local-address extraction
- `CompositeOriginalDestinationResolverTest` verifies chain ordering and null fall-through
- `SoOriginalDstEndToEndIntegrationTest`, `TproxyEndToEndIntegrationTest` and `EbpfOriginalDestinationEndToEndIntegrationTest` are the privileged end-to-end suites. They spin up a sibling Linux container via the Docker CLI (not Testcontainers) with `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` (SO_ORIGINAL_DST / TPROXY) or `--privileged` (eBPF) to set up iptables/BPF rules. They are Docker-gated via `DockerCliTestSupport.isDockerAvailable()` (a `docker info` probe), and additionally SKIP cleanly when the kernel lacks the required module (`xt_TPROXY`/BPF) or when the daemon refuses to start the privileged container (`DockerCliTestSupport.containerStartRejected(...)` — e.g. a user-namespace-remapped daemon rejecting `--privileged`).
- **CI collection:** these three suites are named `*EndToEndIntegrationTest` so Maven Failsafe (`**/*IntegrationTest.java`) collects them. Prior to this they were named `*EndToEndIT`, which matches neither Surefire (`**/*Test.java`) nor Failsafe, so they were never executed on any build. A capable CI step must supply the Docker socket AND run on a daemon that permits `NET_ADMIN`/`--privileged` containers; on the user-namespace-remapped elastic-ci-stack agents the `--privileged` eBPF suite is rejected and SKIPS. See `docs/infrastructure/ci-cd.md` (transparent-proxy end-to-end step).
- `.buildkite/scripts/steps/docker-transparent-proxy-verify.sh <image>` proves a built image end to end: in the image's own JVM both JNA-based resolvers report platform support, and an iptables-REDIRECTed request sent with a deliberately wrong `Host` header still reaches its original destination. TPROXY and eBPF are off and the script fails unless conntrack is unreadable to MockServer, so only `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` can have found it. The iptables/curl and origin sidecars share the MockServer container's network namespace, since the image is distroless. It needs `NET_ADMIN`, so it is run locally, not in CI. Setting the `mockserver.e2e.jar` system property points the three Java suites above at another jar, such as the `mockserver-netty-docker` jar.
- The `TransparentProxyHandler` is tested with an `EmbeddedChannel` to verify `REMOTE_SOCKET` attribute setting and graceful fallback

## Limitations

- **SO_ORIGINAL_DST requires Linux + epoll**: On macOS or Windows, or with NIO transport, the resolver returns null and conntrack (also Linux-only) is tried next. Both fall through to dns-intent on non-Linux hosts.
- **The `mockserver-netty-no-dependencies` library jar falls back to conntrack**: it relocates JNA so that it can sit next to an embedding app's own JNA, so the SO_ORIGINAL_DST and eBPF lookups cannot run from it even on epoll. The published images do not have this limitation: they are built from the `mockserver-netty-docker` jar, which carries JNA unrelocated (see [docker.md](docker.md)).
- **Conntrack lookup is O(n) with a cap**: The `/proc/net/nf_conntrack` scan is capped at 200,000 lines. If the table exceeds this, MockServer falls back to Host-header resolution via dns-intent.
- **iptables required without the webhook**: Without the admission webhook, an init container or external mechanism must configure traffic redirection. With the webhook enabled, iptables rules are injected automatically into opted-in pods.
