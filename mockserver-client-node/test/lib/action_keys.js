 * Single definition of how an expectation's properties split into ACTIONS and everything else,
 * plus the derivation of the action list from the server's own authoritative schema.
 *
 * This lived in four places — three test files and scripts/build_server_typescript.sh — each
 * carrying a comment asserting it was "kept identical to" one of the others. Comments were the
 * only thing holding them in sync. Divergence would have been fail-loud rather than silent
 * (the lists are compared against the same schema), but "fail loudly in a confusing way" is
 * still worse than "cannot diverge".
 *
 * Consumed from Node via require(), and from bash via `node -p` (see build_server_typescript.sh).

 * and the gates then require it to be declared by the client — which is the safe default,
 * because the cost of wrongly treating a non-action as an action is a loud test failure, while
 * the cost of wrongly skipping a real action is an action nobody can create.
