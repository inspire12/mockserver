/*
 * END-TO-END acceptance gate for the Node client's expectation action keys.
 *
 * This is the companion to action_key_coverage_test.js, and it exists because that
 * test — by design — stops one step short of the thing that actually matters.
 *
 *   action_key_coverage_test.js asserts the BYTES THE CLIENT EMITS, captured off the
 *   wire by a throwaway HTTP listener that replies 201 to anything. It proves the
 *   client sends exactly one action. It cannot prove the SERVER ACCEPTS the result,
 *   because the listener is not a server — it accepts payloads a real MockServer
 *   rejects outright. (Its per-action payload `{some: 'action'}` is one such: a real
 *   server 400s it with "is not defined in the schema and the schema does not allow
 *   additional properties".)
 *
 * So this file closes the loop against a REAL MockServer: for every action key the
 * server's own expectation.json schema declares, create an expectation THROUGH THE
 * NODE CLIENT and assert the server both accepted it and stored it with that action.
 * That is the assertion Finding 22 is really about — "gRPC bidi is uncreatable from
 * Node" is a claim about the server's response, not about the client's JSON.
 *
 * Why default headers are set on every case: addDefaultExpectationHeaders returns
 * early when there are no default headers to add, short-circuiting before the action
 * key list is ever consulted. Without setDefaultHeaders these cases cannot observe a
 * missing key and would pass against the unfixed client. (Confirmed by mutation —
 * see the mutation table in the accompanying report.)
 *
 * Requires a running MockServer (supplied by test/run_with_local_server.js, or by
 * MOCKSERVER_HOST/MOCKSERVER_PORT in CI's external mode).
