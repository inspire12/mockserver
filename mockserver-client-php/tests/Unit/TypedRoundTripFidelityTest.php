/**
 * TYPED-MODEL fidelity gate for the PHP client (manifest key "php-typed").
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The sibling {@see RoundTripFidelityTest} deserialises each
 * shared fixture with {@see \MockServer\Expectation::fromArray()}, which stores
 * the decoded array VERBATIM in {@code rawData} and replays it unchanged. That
 * harness therefore records ZERO gaps for every fixture BY CONSTRUCTION — it can
 * never detect a field that the TYPED builders ({@see HttpResponse},
 * {@see HttpForward}, {@see HttpError}, {@see HttpRequest}) fail to model,
 * because none of those classes is on the path it exercises. It is a tautology
 * with respect to typed-model coverage.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. For every shared fixture in
 * {@code test-fixtures/expectations/*.json} this reconstructs each action /
 * matcher block THROUGH THE TYPED MODEL — not via raw replay — and diffs the
 * rebuilt structure back against the fixture (the SERVER-SCHEMA side of the
 * contract). A field the typed class does not DECLARE is silently dropped by the
 * typed round-trip and shows up as a concrete diff path. The cases are derived
 * from the fixture corpus (server schema), never from the client's own key list,
 * so a NEW server field added to the corpus that the typed model has not caught
 * up to fails here rather than passing silently.
 *
 * HOW THE TYPED ROUND-TRIP IS DRIVEN. {@see rebuildTyped()} instantiates the
 * target typed class and, using reflection, copies across ONLY the properties the
 * class actually declares (recursing into declared nested typed properties such
 * as {@code Delay} / {@code ConnectionOptions} / {@code RecoverAfter}). It then
 * serialises via the class's own {@code toArray()}. This makes the reconstruction
 * a faithful mirror of "what the typed model can carry": a declared field
 * survives, an undeclared one is dropped, and a value whose JSON shape is
 * incompatible with the declared property type (e.g. a NottableString object
 * where the model declares {@code ?string}) is dropped too. No field is
 * hand-mapped, so the harness cannot accidentally launder a gap.
 *
 * The zero-vs-nonzero difference from the raw harness is the whole point: this
 * one produces REAL diffs (see {@see GAPS}) that must be individually excused,
 * and the {@see testTypedDropIsFlagged()} positive control proves the gate fires
 * when a typed builder drops a field it is supposed to carry.
