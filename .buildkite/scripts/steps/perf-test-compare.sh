# Every other metric (k6 latency percentiles, growth ratios, rig_valid_peak_achieved_rps,
# live_set_bytes) runs notify-only until it has >=10 clean runs of history and a
# budget derived from them — a gate that fires on noise gets switched off, which is
# the failure mode this design avoids. See docs/plans/performance-programme.md item 1.
#
# Robust stats (median/MAD, not mean/stddev) so a single noisy run doesn't move
# the baseline. Latency/CPU/heap/alloc: higher = worse. Throughput: lower = worse.
# Growth slope ratios also get an ABSOLUTE floor (healthy ≈ 1.0) so steady-state

# seeded object, or a future producer that forgets a check can set `validity.valid:true`
# on output that is structurally-valid JSON but carries NO measured content. Such an
# object sails through the validity gate, then $headmetrics (all-null, dropped by
# `select(.value != null)`) is empty, $missing is empty, no row is produced, and the
# build goes GREEN — "No performance regressions" against a run that measured nothing —
# AND the empty object is persisted, so it silently enters every later baseline window
# (where bmapof drops its nulls, shrinking the comparison set invisibly). This is the
# exact decay docs/plans/performance-programme.md ("Baseline freshness") calls out: a
# freshness check that keys off object age/liveness "passes forever against a producer
# writing valid empty JSON every day", so the newest object must be asserted to contain
# the expected keys with NON-NULL values in PLAUSIBLE RANGES — the same plausibility
# rule the producer applies to itself, applied here independently of what the run
# CLAIMS. The dedicated freshness watchdog (perf-baseline-freshness.sh, pipeline-infra.yml)

# traceback) and would otherwise vanish as a green build — compare is head-driven,

# upstream by perf-test-microbench.sh asserting an exact row count), the laptop
# producer only warns to stderr, so THIS is the equivalent catch. The docker
# sub-items have NO JDK dependency, so their absence is unambiguously a rig failure
# and safe to RED on. Runs AFTER the S3 persist above, so a laptop failure never
# costs the k6 result its place in the baseline history. A run with no

# Not every count is core-driven, and the distinction is the whole point:
# `laptop.*.tcp_sockets` is an lsof line count of listen + established sockets

# cores. It stays hardware-independent. "It is a count" is not the test; "does it
# move when the core count moves" is.

# Filtering the whole baseline at this point was tried first and was wrong:
# dropping non-matching runs drives BASE_COUNT to zero on a hardware change,
# which trips the global `warming up` early-exit ABOVE and skips every metric.

# JMH methodology fingerprint of the HEAD run (item 15c baseline-discontinuity guard).
# microbench / microbench_extra metrics are only comparable against baseline runs
# measured under the SAME .config.jmh — a methodology change (e.g. -f1 6s warmup ->
# -f2 4s warmup) can shift absolute timings, which against a differently-measured
# baseline would fire a SPURIOUS gating regression. So the microbench baseline is the
# subset of runs whose fingerprint matches head; a methodology change self-invalidates
# its own baseline (those metrics take the no-baseline branch until history repopulates
# under the new config), and NO false red fires. Historical runs (no .config.jmh, null)
# never match a new fingerprinted head, so they drop out cleanly. All OTHER metrics
# (k6/growth/rps) keep using the full baseline — this filter is microbench-only.
(.config.jmh // null) as $headjmh
# k6 methodology fingerprint (the k6-side analogue of the JMH .config.jmh guard
# above). The k6 behaviour arms are only comparable against baseline runs measured
# under the SAME methodology, and for k6 that signature is the SET OF CONCURRENTLY-
# RUNNING ARMS (the sorted .behaviours keys) — and nothing else. Two reasons this
# is the right and ONLY key:
#   1. It captures the change that actually broke comparability: five arms
#      (template_mustache/javascript + large_1mb/10mb/file) were added that contend
#      on the core-limited SUT and shift the latencies of the historical arms
#      (match/forward/template/large). Comparing the new 9-arm mix against a
#      baseline measured under the old 4-arm mix is a silently-incomparable baseline
#      (the false-green class the JMH fingerprint fixes; the asymmetry the review
#      flagged).
#   2. It ALREADY encodes the image variant: the JavaScript and file arms exist iff
#      the -graaljs / file-body capability is enabled, so stock-vs-graaljs is
#      implicit in the arm set. It must NOT also key on .config.image_digest — that
#      is the RepoDigest of the MUTABLE mockserver-snapshot-graaljs tag, which
#      changes on every snapshot rebuild (≈ every master merge). The daily/dispatched
#      perf job always pulls the freshest snapshot, so the head digest would match
#      ZERO prior runs, permanently emptying the k6 baseline and turning every arm into a
#      perpetual :new: that never gates — resetting PRECISELY when app code changes,
#      the event these arms exist to catch. (Pre-fix runs also stored a bare image ID,
#      not a RepoDigest, so they could never match either.) The arm set is stable
#      run-to-run: it performs the intended ONE-TIME reset across the 4->9-arm
#      transition, re-arms after MIN_BASELINE matching runs, and then compares
#      straight across snapshot rebuilds (the whole point of a baseline).
# This filter is behaviours-only. growth/sweep/forward are single-arm scenarios not
# affected by the regression arm mix, so they keep the FULL baseline and DO compare
# across the stock->graaljs image change unfiltered — acceptable because the extra
# GraalJS jars are inert for non-JS paths (loaded lazily only when a JS template
# renders): growth.* and rig_valid_peak_achieved_rps are non-gating, and forward.error_rate
# (gating) is a connection-pool guard the template engine cannot influence.

# Hardware-matched subsets, for metrics whose VALUE moves with the machine.
# A timing figure from a different instance type is not a comparable sample, and a
# rolling median that spans a hardware change absorbs the step change instead of
# reporting it. Metrics marked `hw` in perf-budgets.json compare only against runs
# from the same instance type; everything else — allocation bytes, allocation
# ratios, error rates — keeps the FULL baseline, because those are properties of
# the code path rather than the machine.
#
# There are THREE categories here, not two, and missing the third is easy: THREAD
# counts are neither timings nor code-path properties. They track the core count
# (actionHandlerThreadCount defaults to max(5, availableProcessors), and the GC and
# JIT pools scale too), so a 16 -> 48 vCPU move shifts them and they are marked
# `hw` as well.
#
# But do not generalise that to every count. `laptop.*.tcp_sockets` is an lsof line
# count of listen + established sockets, driven by instances and connections rather
# than cores, so it is deliberately NOT marked. The test is "does this move when the
# core count moves", not "is this a count".
#
# The split matters because three of the four gating metrics this script evaluates
# are hardware-INdependent, so filtering the whole baseline would have blinded most
# of its gating during a migration — exactly when a regression is most likely.

# absent-image / revision-mismatch / disabled skip branch it emits ZERO
# clustered_state metrics and no other signal — item 13 could then skip on every run
# for months with the build green and only a buried stderr WARNING. It does NOT fail

# gate: it is caught by the run's clustered_metrics_present validity check, which REDs
# before this step. Only fires for the NEW producer's explicit skip
# (clustered_attempted:false); a pre-feature run (key absent) is exempt.
