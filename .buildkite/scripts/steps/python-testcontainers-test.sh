# Run the mockserver-testcontainers Python suite against a real MockServer
# container started via Testcontainers.
#
# WHY THIS STEP ASSERTS EXPLICITLY (fail closed)
#
#   The @pytest.mark.docker integration tests start a real mockserver/mockserver
#   container and hit it over HTTP, but the fixture calls pytest.skip when Docker
#   is unavailable (matching the repo's assumeTrue(isDockerAvailable()) convention).
#   That graceful skip is correct off-CI, but in CI a skip that reads as green is
#   exactly the silent false positive the Java/Go/.NET/Rust testcontainer steps
#   exist to remove: the previous `pytest -m "not docker"` deselected every
#   container test, so the job passed having started NO container.
#
#   So this step mounts the Docker socket (-s), runs the WHOLE suite (config tests
#   plus the docker-marked integration tests) with output capture disabled so the
#   test's print reaches stdout, then greps for the PYTHON_TESTCONTAINERS_STATUS_OK
#   marker the test prints only after a real container answered PUT
#   /mockserver/status with 200. If the marker is absent — the tests were
#   deselected, renamed, or Docker was unusable — the step fails loudly instead of
#   passing green.
