# Build the MockServer Docker image (source=copy) and prove it actually works —
# not merely that `docker build` exited 0.
#
# WHY
# ---
# The tcnative native .so the image downloads is versioned from a stamp baked into
# the server jar (META-INF/mockserver-tcnative.version). Nothing in CI ever built
# an image on a `docker/**`-only change, so a broken stamp or a Dockerfile that
# stopped pairing the .so with the classes could ship silently (only human review
# caught the last one). This is the build backstop: it runs the fast two-jar
# derive check FIRST (verify-tcnative-stamp.sh), then builds a real image and
# asserts the native actually loads at runtime.
#
# THE SAME SCRIPT RUNS IN CI AND LOCALLY — that is the point. It detects rather
# than assumes its environment (host arch, corporate CA bundle, buildkite-agent),
# so a developer on an arm64 Mac and a Buildkite agent run identical logic.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS (fails closed — non-zero exit — on any):
#   * the two-jar tcnative stamp derive check passes (delegated);
#   * the runtime image contains the arch-correct tcnative .so under /usr/lib/,
#     named for this host's arch AND carrying the matching ELF e_machine (a
#     wrong-arch .so is a failure, not a pass);
#   * the native TLS provider actually LOADS in the image's own JVM
#     (OpenSsl.isAvailable() == true — proving the image reproduces source=download's
#     real native-TLS behaviour. NOTE the assembly jar BUNDLES the per-platform
#     natives, so Netty loads the native from the jar, not from the /usr/lib .so this
#     image downloads — this probe does NOT isolate that download. Wrong/empty/missing
#     stamps are caught upstream by verify-tcnative-stamp.sh and the Dockerfile's own
#     empty-check, and assert_so_present below separately asserts the arch-correct
#     /usr/lib .so exists);
#   * the native epoll transport loads (Epoll.isAvailable) — the jarprep trim keeps
#     only this arch's natives, so a wrong-arch trim degrades epoll to NIO silently;
#   * native TLS STILL loads under `docker run --read-only` (no --tmpfs /tmp) — the
#     one check that actually exercises the /usr/lib .so's purpose: with a read-only
#     /tmp Netty cannot extract the jar-bundled native, so BoringSSL survives only
#     via System.loadLibrary finding /usr/lib/libnetty_tcnative_linux_*.so. This is
#     what guards the `COPY ... /usr/lib/` line against a silent removal;
#   * the container starts, answers its health check, and completes a real TLS
#     handshake on its port;
#   * with metrics enabled, the Prometheus scrape includes jvm_memory_allocated_bytes
#     — the guard that the jlink runtime kept jdk.management (com.sun.management.ThreadMXBean).
#
# ARCH TRAP
#   The image is built WITHOUT --build-arg TARGETARCH, exactly as the release and
#   snapshot pushes build it, so the arch comes from BuildKit's own injection. A
#   stage-level default (`ARG TARGETARCH=amd64`) overrides that injection — it is
#   how the arm64 images shipped x86_64 natives — and passing the arg here would hide
#   it. We DETECT the host arch only to know which .so and ELF machine to expect.
#
# CA STAGING
#   docker/ensure-ca-bundle.sh stages ca-bundle.pem into the build context (the
#   corporate root when MOCKSERVER_LOCAL_CA_BUNDLE / AWS_CA_BUNDLE point at one,
#   else an empty placeholder). We ALWAYS remove what we staged on exit — the
#   scratch bundle and the staged jar must never be left in the tree.
#
# SELF-TEST HOOKS (mirror check-certificate-expiry.sh's env overrides)
#   DOCKER_VERIFY_SKIP_BUILD=true   run the runtime assertions against an existing
#                                   image instead of building (fast red/green).
#   DOCKER_VERIFY_IMAGE=<ref>       assert against this image ref (point at a stock
#                                   image with no .so to prove the guards go red).
#   DOCKER_VERIFY_SO_OVERRIDE=<path-in-image>  force the expected .so path (point
#                                   at the wrong arch to prove the presence guard).
#
# Requires: docker, tar, and a jar (built on demand via mvnw if absent). Runs the
# probe compile in a throwaway temurin JDK container, so it needs no host JDK.

# from it is therefore a faithful local reproduction of the DEFAULT published
# image without needing a post-stamp release.
#
# WHY THIS JAR and not the shaded no-dependencies one: the assembly jar bundles the
# per-platform tcnative natives, so the native provider actually loads at runtime
# and the OpenSsl.isAvailable() assertion below is a real, green native-TLS check —
# which is exactly source=download's behaviour. (The shaded no-dependencies jar
# strips the natives; in the distroless base the standalone /usr/lib .so does not
# dlopen, so that path silently runs on the JDK provider — which is by design for
# docker/local, but is NOT the tcnative path this gate exists to protect.) The
# two-jar derive check still independently covers the shaded jar's stamp.
# nullglob is enabled at script scope (see top of file), so an unmatched caller
# glob arrives here as ZERO args and this returns non-zero — never the literal
# pattern. Do NOT toggle nullglob inside this function: the glob is expanded by the
# caller before we run, so a local shopt here would be too late to matter.
