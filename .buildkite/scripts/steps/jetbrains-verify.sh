# Runs the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier against the recommended IDE set (configured in
# mockserver-jetbrains/build.gradle.kts -> intellijPlatform.pluginVerification). This
# catches internal/deprecated/incompatible IntelliJ Platform API usages before a
# Marketplace upload is rejected. The verifier downloads several IDEs from the
# JetBrains CDN, so this is slower than the unit-test step and gets its own timeout.
#
# Same containerisation rationale as jetbrains-test.sh: runs as root in a plain JDK 17
# image (the Gradle wrapper provides Gradle 9.5.1 for the IntelliJ Platform plugin
# 2.16), and builds inside an in-container copy under /tmp so root-owned Gradle output
# (build/, .gradle/, .kotlin/, .intellijPlatform/) never lands in the mounted
# workspace and breaks the next build's git checkout/clean.
#
# After verification (pass OR fail) the per-IDE verifier report is copied back into the
# mounted workspace at mockserver-jetbrains/build/reports/pluginVerifier so the pipeline
# step's artifact_paths can upload it for diagnosis. The copied tree is chmod'd
# world-writable so the (non-root) agent can git-clean it on the next checkout despite
# being created by root. The verifier's exit code is preserved so a real finding still
# reddens the build.
#
# --cache gradle mounts .buildkite-cache/gradle/{caches,wrapper-dists} at
# ~/.gradle/{caches,wrapper/dists}. With `ides { recommended() }` the Plugin Verifier's
# IDEs are resolved as ORDINARY Gradle dependencies and extracted UNDER ~/.gradle/caches
# (CI logs read every IDE from /root/.gradle/caches/9.5.1/transforms/<hash>/transformed/
# idea*-<ver>) -- i.e. INSIDE GRADLE_USER_HOME, so they sit on this mount alongside the
# Gradle distribution and the resolved SDK/Kotlin/Gson. intellijPlatformIdesCache /
# intellijPlatformIdesCacheEnabled do NOT apply to recommended() and change nothing here.
# recommended() currently resolves to 7 IDEs: a verify downloads ~4.18 GB and leaves
# ~28 GB extracted in ~/.gradle/caches (~10-20 GB compressed).
#
# WARNING: this cache currently persists NOTHING. Restore, verify and save are three
# SEPARATE Buildkite jobs; each job's "Preparing working directory" runs `git clean
# -ffxdq`, which deletes the workspace-local .buildkite-cache between jobs (and the jobs
# can land on different ephemeral agents with no shared filesystem). So the save step
# finds no directory and no-ops, and every restore is a 404 miss -- confirmed run after
# run in mockserver-editors #523-#525 (and identically for maven in mockserver-java).
# GRADLE_USER_HOME stays at /root/.gradle regardless of the /tmp/jb working dir.
