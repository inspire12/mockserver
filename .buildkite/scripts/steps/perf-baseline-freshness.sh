# Baseline-freshness assertion for the daily performance-regression control.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The perf regression control (perf-test-compare.sh) compares every run against a
# rolling baseline in S3, refreshed by the DAILY perf pipeline. If that pipeline
# stops firing, or fires but its run breaks, the baseline silently goes stale and
# every subsequent comparison measures an ancient number while still reporting
# green. That is the exact decay this programme exists to eliminate (a JMH backstop
# in this repo went dark for four days unnoticed — see
# docs/plans/performance-programme.md, "Keeping the system itself alive").
#
# WHAT IT KEYS OFF (and what it deliberately does NOT)
# ----------------------------------------------------
# It asserts PRODUCER LIVENESS via the Buildkite API — that the daily
# `mockserver-performance-test` pipeline is still firing on its schedule and its
# most recent SCHEDULED build completed successfully. It does NOT gate on the raw
# age of the newest S3 object, because that conflates two different things:
#
#   * The producer is COMMIT-GATED: perf-test-guard.sh deliberately writes no new
#     object when master has not moved since the last run. So a genuinely quiet
#     stretch ages the newest object with a perfectly healthy producer — an
#     object-age gate cries wolf on quiet master and, sitting in a different
#     pipeline, dumps that false red on whoever next touches an infra path.
#
#   * A "ran, then skipped because master had not moved" scheduled build is the
#     producer working CORRECTLY. It shows up as a `passed` scheduled build, so
#     liveness treats it as healthy; object age cannot tell it apart from death.
#
# WHAT LIVENESS DETECTS — AND THE RESIDUAL GAP IT DOES NOT
# --------------------------------------------------------
# DETECTED: the schedule stopped firing (STALLED / NO_SCHEDULE), and the most
# recent COMPLETED scheduled build did not pass (NOT_PASSED — the run broke, or a
# gating regression fired).
#
# NOT DETECTED: a scheduled build that goes GREEN while writing no fresh baseline.
# perf-test-compare.sh currently has two such paths — an invalid run annotates an
# error and then `exit 0` WITHOUT persisting (perf-test-compare.sh:160-172), and
# the persist itself is NON-FATAL (`aws s3 cp ... || echo "WARNING: failed to
# persist ..."`, perf-test-compare.sh:179), so an S3 write failure also leaves the
# build `passed`. A green-but-didn't-write build is therefore NOT caught here; it
# is the PRODUCER's responsibility to make those paths fatal (that producer fix is
# being made separately). This check cannot cover the gap itself, because confirming
# a write would need to READ the object, and that needs perf-bucket S3 access the
# `trigger` queue does not have — terraform/buildkite-agents (main.tf / build-secrets
# .tf) grant the trigger queue ONLY the Buildkite API tokens; the `perf` queue role
# holds the perf-results grant. A fail-closed S3 read on this queue would be a
# PERMANENT false red (the "control removed because it turned the pipeline red"
# failure mode the plan warns about), so the earlier object-content check was
# dropped. Once the producer makes the two paths above fatal, a failed-to-write run
# surfaces here as NOT_PASSED and the gap closes to whatever compare still allows;
# until then it is an explicit, known seam — recorded here rather than hidden behind
# a false reassurance. Producer liveness needs only the API token the trigger queue
# already has.
#
# WHERE IT RUNS
# -------------
# In `mockserver-infra` (see pipeline-infra.yml) — a DIFFERENT pipeline from the
# producer, on the cheap `trigger` queue, and on its OWN daily Buildkite schedule
# (terraform/buildkite-pipelines/pipelines.tf) offset from the producer's 04:00
# slot. A check that lives inside the system it monitors dies with it; this one
# does not, and its own schedule gives it a guaranteed cadence rather than relying
# on someone happening to touch an infra path.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT
# --------------------
# Every uncertain outcome FAILS (non-zero exit). It never passes by defaulting.
# The classes are kept distinct in the message so the operator knows which one they
# have WITHOUT opening the code:
#   - NO_SCHEDULE : the producer's whole branch history has no daily scheduled build
#                   (the schedule was deleted/disabled, or the pipeline was renamed).
#   - STALLED     : the newest daily scheduled build is older than the window (the
#                   cron stopped firing) — including when none falls in the lookback
#                   and the older history inspected has none either — or none in the
#                   lookback has finished (the producer is wedged).
#   - NOT_PASSED  : the most recent COMPLETED scheduled build did not pass (the
#                   producer ran but broke, or flagged a gating regression — either
#                   way a human must look before the baseline is trusted).
#   - TRUNCATED   : the page cap was reached before the builds needed for a verdict
#                   were seen, so liveness is unknown.
#   - DENIED      : the Buildkite API token is missing/expired or unauthorised.
#   - TRANSPORT   : the Buildkite API was unreachable or returned an unusable body.
#   - CONFIG      : an override (window, lookback, page cap) is malformed.
#
# HOW IT QUERIES
# --------------
# By time (created_from, paged via the Link header), never by "the N newest builds",
# because manual runs crowd scheduled builds off any fixed page. Older history is read
# only when the lookback holds no daily scheduled build, to tell STALLED from NO_SCHEDULE.
