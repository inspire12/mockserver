# Fail closed when a NEW shared-RNG call site appears on a server hot path.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Three separate sweeps removed shared-random-number-generator contention from
# MockServer's request hot paths, each by ENUMERATING one call shape:
#   • UUIDService.getUUID()       — 26 sites switched to getNonSecureUUID()
#   • java.util.UUID.randomUUID() — 13 files switched (draws from the JDK's
#                                   own shared static SecureRandom)
#   • Math.random() / new Random()— the third tier (this sweep)
# Every sweep found exactly what it searched for and nothing else, so the NEXT
# shape was invisible until someone thought to grep for it. The enumeration
# method — not the judgement — was the defect, twice. A grep-once fix does not
# stop the shape reappearing; only a standing, always-on control does.
#
# All four of these delegate to a process-wide generator whose core step is a
# synchronized/AtomicLong-CAS loop:
#   • Math.random()          → one shared static java.util.Random
#   • new Random()  (no arg) → seeds from the shared static seedUniquifier CAS
#                              loop AND allocates a generator per call
#   • UUID.randomUUID()      → the JDK's shared static SecureRandom (native
#                              PRNG monitor)
#   • new SecureRandom(...)  → a fresh SecureRandom; flagged so a new one on a
#                              hot path is a conscious, reviewed decision
# On the request path that monitor/CAS serialises the worker event loops under
# load. The contention-free alternatives are ThreadLocalRandom.current() (for a
# value that needs only uniqueness) and UUIDService.getNonSecureUUID() (for an
# internal id). A value whose UNGUESSABILITY is a genuine security property
# keeps its SecureRandom / secure UUID and is allow-listed below with the reason.
#
# Seeded new Random(seed) is deliberately NOT matched: the seeded constructor
# bypasses seedUniquifier, does not contend, and is load-bearing for
# reproducibility (e.g. EmbeddingVectors.seededFallbackVector,
# StreamingPhysicsExpander). Only the no-arg new Random() contends.
#
# SCOPE
#
# The server RUNTIME modules that carry the request hot path: mockserver-core,
# mockserver-netty, mockserver-async (src/main only). Deliberately EXCLUDED:
#   • mockserver-integration-testing/src/main — test-support code, not runtime;
#     its UUID.randomUUID() calls are test assertions, pure noise here.
#   • mockserver-client-java — a client library, not the server hot path.
# Pure comment lines (leading //, * or /*) and any text after a // on a code line are
# stripped before matching, so a pattern named in such a comment never trips the guard.
# An inline C-style /* ... */ span on a code line is NOT stripped, so a pattern named
# inside one would FALSE-POSITIVE (fail the build, noisily) — never a false negative,
# since commented-out code does not run. Rare enough to leave as-is; move such a mention
# to a // comment if it trips.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (stated honestly, as check-false-green-guards.sh does)
#
# The allow-list is keyed by FILE, not by line, so it is robust to line drift but
# it will NOT catch a second, new bad use ADDED to a file already allow-listed for
# that pattern. That trade buys zero false positives and no line-number churn. The
# high-value case — a brand-new RNG call site in a file that has none today — is
# exactly what the earlier sweeps missed, and that IS caught: a new site lands in a
# not-yet-listed file and fails the build. A rot check (below) fails the build if
# any allow-list entry no longer matches, so the list can never quietly go stale.
#
# Requires: git, grep, awk. Runs directly on the agent (no Docker). Bash 3.2 safe.
