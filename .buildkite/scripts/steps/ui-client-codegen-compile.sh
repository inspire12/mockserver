# Permanent CI gate: compile / syntax-check the dashboard composer's GENERATED
# client code for Python, Ruby, Go and Rust.
#
# The composer emits client code in seven languages. Java is gated by
# ui-java-codegen-compile.sh (javac) and C# by ComposerCodegenEquivalenceTests.cs;
# Node is gated by the tsc type-proof in src/lib/codegen/node.test.ts (run under
# `npm test`). The remaining four had NO compile gate — a client-API rename or an
# emitter bug that produced invalid source would ship broken generated code
# silently, caught by nothing (the existing per-language tests only string/byte
# compare the emitter output; they never feed it to a compiler).
#
# This gate drives the SHARED representative composer matrix
# (mockserver-ui/src/lib/codegen/extractParityCases.ts — the exact `combos` the
# byte-identity parity tests use) through the requested language's emitter and
# runs the lightest CREDIBLE check for that toolchain:
#
#   python  python -m py_compile   syntax/parse (dynamic client -> no static API check)
#   ruby    ruby -c                syntax/parse (dynamic client -> no static API check)
#   go      go build/vet ./...     FULL compile against the real mockserver-client-go
#   rust    cargo check --bins     FULL compile against the real mockserver-client-rust
#
# Go and Rust are statically typed and their clients live in this monorepo, so
# their checks catch API drift (a renamed client method fails the build) — the
# direct analog of the Java javac gate. Python and Ruby are dynamically typed with
# no shipped type stubs, so a syntax check is the strongest credible static gate:
# it fails on any emitter bug that produces malformed source. All four are proven
# to go red (see the commit's red/green evidence).
#
# TWO phases, each in the toolchain it needs:
#   1. node:22           run the emitter (Node native TS type-stripping; NO npm ci,
#                        the codegen modules are dependency-free).
#   2. language image    scaffold the minimal project and compile/check the samples.
#
# CI runs each phase inside its Docker image via run-in-docker.sh (the raw agent
# has no node/python/ruby/go/cargo). For fast local validation set
# CODEGEN_COMPILE_USE_DOCKER=false to run the exact same command strings against
# host toolchains instead.
#
# USAGE: ui-client-codegen-compile.sh <python|ruby|go|rust>
