#   2. regression.js over HTTP, then over HTTPS+H2  -> per-behaviour latency
#   3. growth.js (sustained load) with a background CPU/heap sampler
#      -> resource-growth slope ratios (issue #2329 class)
#   4. assemble result.json {metadata, behaviours, growth, resources}
#
# Co-located load-gen + server: on a >=16 vCPU box the server, upstream and k6
# are core-pinned to disjoint cpusets so they don't steal cycles (the single
# biggest factor in number quality). On a smaller box pinning is skipped with a
# warning — numbers are then noisier but the run still works for local checks.
#
# Durations pass through to k6 via K6_* env (defaults in k6/lib/config.js). The
# MockServer image is MOCKSERVER_IMAGE (default snapshot).

# --- event-log body-byte budget: the OOM guard that keeps the run alive ---------
# WHY THIS EXISTS (build #249 died here). MockServer records every request AND its
# response in a COUNT-bounded event-log ring of maxLogEntries entries, holding the
# FULL body of each. On the 2 GB GraalJS SUT the heap is MaxRAMPercentage=45% ~= 0.9 GiB, so
# maxLogEntries = min(heapKB/8, 250000) ~= 115,500. An entry lives for the ring's
# residence = maxLogEntries / total_ACHIEVED_insertion_rps, and — this is the trap —
# residence LENGTHENS without bound as achieved throughput FALLS. The MB-scale
# regression arms (large_1mb/large_10mb/large_file, k6 item 15d) then retain, per arm,
# roughly rate x residence x body:
#     arm          rate     body     @ residence 172 s (total ~901 rps, healthy)
#     large_10mb   0.1/s    10 MB    -> 0.1 x 172 x 10 MB  ~= 172 MB
#     large_1mb    0.5/s     1 MB    -> 0.5 x 172 x  1 MB  ~=  86 MB
#     large_file   0.5/s    ~1 MB    -> 0.5 x 172 x  1 MB  ~=  86 MB   (its ~1 MB RESPONSE)
#     large(4KB)   200/s     4 KB    -> 200 x 172 x  4 KB  ~= 137 MB
# ~480 MB of large bodies looks safe under 0.9 GiB — but ONLY at residence 172 s. When
# the SUT contends (the pre-fix JavaScript contagion, or the EXTRA body throughput the
# 2026-09-17 dispatch-pool fixes eec183f7e/7fbae1350 now ADMIT), total achieved rps
# collapses, residence 2x/4x/10x, and every figure above scales with it — there is no
# upper bound as achieved rps -> 0. Two back-to-back protocol passes (http then
# https_h2) compound it. That is what pushed retention past the heap in build #249 and
# killed the container mid-run, so the second (https_h2) pass could not even seed
# ("no such host").
# THE FIX: bound RETENTION, not rate. maxEventLogSizeInBytes is MockServer's own OOM
# guard (MOCKSERVER_MAX_EVENT_LOG_SIZE_IN_BYTES) — when > 0 the ring ALSO enforces a
# body-byte budget, evicting oldest-first until total logged body bytes fit, in
# addition to the count bound. Retention is then capped at the budget REGARDLESS of
# residence, so no rate x residence product can run away however far throughput falls.
# 256 MiB is the documented starting point for a 2 GB container. At ERROR the whole log (retained
# entries plus ring backlog) measures at most ~1.7x its budget (docs/code/memory-management.md),
# ~430 MiB, leaving more than half of the 0.9 GiB heap for everything else.
# WHY NOT SHRINK maxLogEntries INSTEAD: growth.js runs on THIS SAME SUT and must fill
# the DEFAULT ~115.5k ring to reproduce the issue #2329 O(n)-eviction slope; a smaller
# ring would never fill and would hide the bug. The byte budget does NOT corrupt growth
# because growth loads only the tiny /simple body (~hundreds of bytes) — its total
# retained bytes across ~115.5k entries stay in the tens of MB, far below 256 MiB, so the
# byte budget never fires for growth and its count-bounded fill is untouched. Applied to
# EVERY SUT that runs regression.js with the MB arms: the main SUT here and the clustered
# A/B nodes (start_clu) — the clustered image runs the same large_1mb/large_10mb arms on
# a 1.0 GiB heap and was at the identical risk.

# Two tiers, chosen so the tracked baseline is never silently shifted (the log-level lesson):
#
#   TIER 1 — ALWAYS ON, and genuinely near-zero so the tracked baseline stays comparable with
#   months of stored S3 history measured WITHOUT it. Only flags that are INERT until an
#   OutOfMemoryError fires — nothing runs on a healthy request path, so the baseline cannot be
#   silently offset. Everything lands on a HOST-mounted volume ($DIAG_DIR -> /diag) so it survives
#   the container's death, plus host-side capture of the container's post-mortem (docker inspect
#   .State / docker logs) which is the piece --rm destroyed.
#     -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError  a JVM OOM is then unambiguous + immediate (no half-dead server)
#     -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError + -XX:HeapDumpPath=/diag  a heap dump that OUTLIVES the container
#     (host-side, no JVM flag) dense sampler + docker inspect .State + streamed docker logs
#   GC FILE LOGGING is NOT tier 1. -Xlog:gc* is always-on and writes a line per GC event to a bind
#   mount; its cost scales with GC frequency (highest on the large-body arms this proof did not
#   exercise) and a single within-noise measurement cannot show it sub-1% — the honest upper bound
#   is ~2%, enough to permanently offset a baseline series compared against months of history. That
#   is the ONE outcome this design must protect against, so GC logging is TIER 2. The coarse heap/RSS
#   trajectory is still captured tier-1 by the host-side sampler at zero SUT cost.
#   NATIVE-vs-HEAP discrimination in tier 1 is done with FREE signals, NOT NMT: the sampler records
#   the CONTAINER RSS (docker stats, host-side) beside the JVM heap, and the failure path records
#   docker inspect .State.OOMKilled. OOMKilled=true with heap headroom => native/cgroup kill (Netty
#   direct buffers a heap dump cannot see); a JVM OutOfMemoryError in the log => heap. NMT itself is
#   documented at 5-10% overhead, so it too would shift the baseline and is TIER 2, not tier 1.
#
#   TIER 2 — OPT-IN via PERF_JVM_DIAGNOSTICS=deep, for an INVESTIGATION run only. Costs throughput,
#   so it MUST be off for the run that writes the baseline (the default 'standard' leaves it off).

#
# On the c5.4xlarge this queue used to run, the defaults asked for 6 (server) + 1
# (upstream) + 6 (k6) = 13 cores on a box with 16 vCPU but only EIGHT physical
# cores. Thirteen into eight does not go, so k6 necessarily ran on the sibling
# threads of cores the server was already saturating. Every throughput figure the
# rig produced was therefore a measurement of a server sharing silicon with its own
# load generator, and it is the main reason "the client saturates first" blocked
# the knee for so long (k6 read 600.9% against its 600% pin on a VALID run).
#
# Nothing caught it because the check above was `_NPROCESSORS_ONLN >= 16`, which
# counts LOGICAL cpus — the one number that cannot detect this. So the check now
# resolves real topology and fails the run rather than quietly producing a figure
# that means something other than it claims.
# Thin wrapper preserving this run's call site (assert_cpusets_physically_disjoint
# || exit 1 below): it hands this run's three cpuset globals to the shared,
# generalised checker in lib/perf-cpu-topology.sh. The proof itself — /sys topology
# resolution, CI fail-closed vs off-CI warn, the reversed-range-is-fatal rule, and
# the bash-3.2-safe seen-cores table (no `local -A`) — lives ONCE in that lib and is
# shared with the multi-process client rig, so the two cannot drift. An unpinned
# global is passed through as an empty spec, which the checker skips.

# agent happens to have cached — build #264 measured an entirely cached image with
# nothing tying it to the commit under test. Pull ONCE up front rather than
# `--pull always` on each of the ~6 `docker run` calls below: --pull always would
# re-query the registry per container (upstream, SUT, stream SUT, clustered nodes,
# INFO SUT) for the same tag; a single pull freshens the shared local image once.
# DECISION (part D asked to argue it): pull, don't skip. Cost is one pull (seconds)
# against a 45-60 min run — negligible — and it does add a registry-availability
# dependency, but the FIRST-ever run already needs the registry, and a registry
# outage is better surfaced loudly here than by silently measuring a stale image.
# Best-effort by design: if the pull fails but a cached image exists the run still
# proceeds, because the provenance check below is the real backstop — it refuses to
# attribute the run if the (cached) image was built from another commit, so a stale
# pull can never masquerade as a fresh measurement. The recorded image_digest
# (RepoDigest) then reflects whatever was actually pulled/used.

# `docker image inspect "$CLU_IMAGE"`, and NOTHING in the perf flow ever pulled or
# built that image — so on a scale-to-zero perf agent (a fresh box every run) the
# inspect always failed and the block took its absent-image skip on every single
# run. The image is now published as a mutable snapshot tag by the same job that
# publishes the SUT image, so it is obtained the same way the SUT is: one pull of a
# mutable tag, up front, once.
#
# WHY UP HERE and not in the clustered block: the run is ATTRIBUTED to the SUT
# image's revision label, and the clustered arm is only meaningful if it executed the
# SAME commit's code. Both tags move together on a master merge, so pulling them
# seconds apart keeps them paired; pulling the clustered tag ~40 min later (where the
# A/B runs) would let a merge landing mid-run hand us a NEWER clustered image than the
# SUT — a mismatch that produces an arithmetically fine ratio filed under the wrong
# commit. The revision equality check in the clustered block is the backstop that
# catches it either way; this placement just makes the mismatch rare.
#
# Best-effort, exactly like the SUT pull: a failed pull leaves whatever is cached, and
# the absent-image / revision-mismatch guards below decide what to do. It must NOT
# abort the run — the clustered A/B is notify-only and the k6/growth result is not.

# local image id when built without a digest (locally-built image). RepoDigests is
# an IMAGE property and does NOT exist on a container, so we must resolve the
# container's image id first (.Image) and inspect the IMAGE — NOT the container.
# Inspecting the container reads a key that is absent there: older Docker CLIs
# (missingkey=invalid) rendered that as empty and silently fell through to the
# container's .Image (the image id, never the RepoDigest), but Docker 29.x
# (missingkey=error) makes the missing key a hard template error, so the value
# came back empty and tripped the fail-closed guard below for a digest that is in
# fact perfectly resolvable. On the image, RepoDigests is always a present key
# (an empty list for a locally-built image), so the {{if}} degrades cleanly to the
# documented .Id fallback rather than erroring. Only a genuine inability to inspect
# the image at all leaves this empty — which is meant to fail closed.

# the harness scripts. So the result is FILED UNDER (and keyed in stored history by)
# the SUT image's OWN commit — its org.opencontainers.image.revision label — whenever
# that label is a trustworthy, well-formed git SHA (ATTRIBUTED_COMMIT below). The
# Buildkite build's commit (this checkout of the perf scripts) is recorded SEPARATELY
# as HARNESS_COMMIT: if the harness changed, the measurement METHOD changed and a
# reader must see both. This deliberately STOPS treating image-lag — a snapshot tag
# that trails master by one java-pipeline duration — as a failure: a lagging image was
# measured correctly and is attributable to the commit it was built from, which is
# exactly what this result now records (build #284's three-docs-commit lag was a false
# alarm under the old equality check). Three outcomes, and provenance STILL fails
# closed in the ones that matter:
#   well-formed label -> provenance_ok=true : ATTRIBUTED_COMMIT = the image revision;
#               attributable; the validity check passes.
#   malformed  label -> provenance_ok=false: the label is present but is NOT a 40-hex
#               git SHA (empty-vs-garbage: an EMPTY label is absence, not garbage, and
#               takes the grace path; a non-empty non-SHA is HOSTILE). The attribution
#               key cannot be trusted, so the run is NOT attributable — recorded as a
#               FAILED validity check so perf-test-compare.sh refuses to persist or
#               compare it AND reds the build, REUSING the existing validity gate. This

# --- image freshness: detect a FROZEN snapshot tag (closes the frozen-image false green) ---
# The provenance fix above deliberately STOPS treating image-lag as a failure — a lagging
# image is truthfully filed under its own commit. But that removes the only alarm for a
# distinct failure mode it must not mask: a snapshot pipeline that has STOPPED. If
# java-docker-push-snapshot.sh (master-gated) goes red for a week, or the push breaks, the
# mutable tag freezes; the daily run then pulls the SAME binary every day, files every point
# under the same (truthfully-labelled) old commit, and provenance_ok reads true forever — a
# green chain measuring nothing new. The freshness watchdog (perf-baseline-freshness.sh) does
# NOT catch this: it asserts producer LIVENESS via the Buildkite API and, by its own comment,
# cannot detect "a scheduled build that goes GREEN while writing no fresh baseline" (the
# trigger queue has no perf-bucket S3 read to see the series freeze). So making it fatal is
# the PRODUCER's job, exactly as that watchdog states.
# The signal that needs no git history and no cross-run state: the image's OWN build age
# (.Created). When the snapshot factory is alive, every perf run (which only fires when master
# moved) measures a freshly-built image; a measured image older than the bound means the
# factory stopped. Emitted into the config block; perf-test-compare.sh reds the build on it
# (a stale image is a valid measurement of that binary, but NOT a valid daily-cadence data
# point, and green here would be undetectable per the watchdog gap above). FAIL CLOSED: a
# non-integer threshold, or an unparseable/absent .Created, is treated as STALE — a freshness
# check that cannot date the image must not pass by default (the jq-ordering-trap lesson: guard

# --- dense JVM-internals resource-trajectory sampler ---------------------------------------------
# Runs across the WHOLE load window (regression -> sweep -> growth), the phase where builds 261/264
# died at a reproducible 2m20s / ~37k iterations. Denser than the growth sampler (default 2s) because
# a reproducible cliff at a fixed iteration count is a cumulative-memory signature: to attribute it we
# must see the trajectory APPROACHING the cliff, not just its aftermath. Every column is host-side
# (curl + docker stats), so the SUT pays nothing — this is tier 1.
#   container_mem_bytes / limit   the CONTAINER RSS incl. off-heap — climbing while heap is flat is the
#                                 near-zero native-growth signal (no NMT needed)
#   heap_used / nonheap / gc / threads   the JVM levels already scraped elsewhere
#   dropped_log_events            > 0 at death implicates the event-log ring directly
#   ring_occupancy / in_flight_bytes (+ their ceilings)  the IN-FLIGHT event-log site: entries on the
#                                 disruptor ring not yet processed. The ring BACKING UP — the
#                                 product-side gauges added in this same change; blank on an older SUT
#                                 image that predates them (graceful), populated once a snapshot with
#                                 them is built.
#   retained_entries / retained_bytes (+ their ceilings)  the RETAINED event-log site: entries kept in
#                                 the deque AFTER processing. Read alongside the ring columns to
#                                 attribute the heap to the right site — an empty ring with a full
#                                 retained deque means the retained log is holding the heap, not the
#                                 backlog. Same graceful-blank behaviour on an older image.
#   evicted_log_entries           entries dropped once the event log hit its max size — silent
#                                 evidence loss the dropped_log_events counter does NOT cover.
#   req_dur_count/_sum + _le_*ms  the server's OWN request-duration histogram (receipt->response).
#                                 _count is the population; the le=5/10/25/50/100ms cumulative counts
#                                 bracket the tail so a SERVER-side p99 can be reconstructed and set
#                                 against k6's CLIENT p99 — the test of whether the tail is in-server.
#   jvm_allocated_bytes           cumulative allocation counter; its delta over req_dur_count's delta is
#                                 the allocation per request for any window
#   direct_buffer_used_bytes / _count, netty_direct_used_bytes  OFF-HEAP buffer memory (the NIO "direct"
#                                 pool, and Netty's own counter where Netty keeps one), so an allocator
#                                 change can be judged on native memory, not just heap
#   scrape_ts                     when the metrics scrape started; `ts` precedes it by the docker-stats
#                                 call (1-2 s), which matters when a row is placed inside a sweep rung
# A BLANK JVM-metric column has THREE distinct meanings, all preserved and NOT conflated: (1) the

# The CI ladder now climbs PAST the ~32-36k knee (published saturation) to
# 48k/64k so saturation is actually reached rather than stopping where the server
# is still comfortable (the old default topped out at 16k). Adds ~4 min. A rung is
# only a valid server-ceiling candidate if the k6 CLIENT had headroom there, so we
# sample the k6 container's CPU throughout and read k6's own dropped_iterations per
# rung, then derive saturation_rps from the highest CLEANLY-served rung.

# --- INFO-log-level publication arm (plan open question 5) ---------------------
# Re-measure ONLY the two PUBLISHED figure families — the knee curve (sweep.js) and
# the per-behaviour percentiles (regression.js, http + https_h2) — against a SECOND
# SUT running at the SHIPPED-DEFAULT log level (INFO). The owner's decision: the
# tracked baseline stays ERROR (a performance-sensitive user really does set ERROR,
# so publishing it is legitimate and every historical S3 run is ERROR), but the
# INFO figure is published ALONGSIDE it and LABELLED as INFO so nobody is misled
# about the out-of-the-box number.
#
# NON-GATING BY CONSTRUCTION. This arm never fails the step and never touches the
# ERROR baseline: (1) its output lands under DISTINCT keys (info_log_level_arm.*),
# not .behaviours / .sweep / rig_valid_peak_achieved_rps, so it can never be confused with or
# diffed against the ERROR series; (2) it is EXCLUDED from VALIDITY_CHECKS, so an
# INFO hiccup cannot flip validity.valid and block the ERROR baseline from being
# stored; (3) every fallible command is guarded so a failure degrades to
# measured:false, not an aborted run. Plan open question 9: land notify-only,
# observe ten runs, THEN attach a budget — the info_* budget entries carry no
# `gating` (notify-only) and `provisional: true` until that history exists.
#
# The INFO SUT is pinned to the SAME cpuset as the ERROR SUT (SERVER_CPUS) and runs
# HERE, right after the ERROR sweep, while the ERROR SUT is idle — so the INFO knee
# is measured under the same core budget as the ERROR knee (a fair comparison) with
# negligible contention. It is torn down immediately afterwards to free its heap
# before the growth phase. regression.js / sweep.js each seed AND reset the SUT they
# target, so pointing them at the INFO alias keeps the two SUTs isolated.

# --- proxy.js: item 9a (forward proxy) + item 14 (TLS/mTLS handshake) ----------
# ONE run, TWO phases (the plan: item 14 shares item 9a's containers and run):
#   9a  forward mode — MockServer AS A PROXY. The k6 container gets HTTP_PROXY /
#       HTTPS_PROXY pointed at the SUT, so an http:// upstream target becomes an
#       absolute-URI forward and an https:// target a CONNECT tunnel carrying TLS
#       through the SUT to the upstream already started for the run (MockServer may
#       terminate that tunnel TLS itself with a generated cert). Emits a
#       .behaviours object (forward_absolute_proxy / forward_connect_proxy) that
#       perf-test-compare.sh picks up via its existing behaviours.* budgets with NO
#       jq change — which DOES grow the k6 arm-set fingerprint and so resets the k6
#       baseline ONCE (intended: the arm set changed). The SUT is NOT reset/seeded
#       for this — an absolute-URI/CONNECT request addressed to the UPSTREAM is
#       proxied regardless of the SUT's own expectations.
#   14  handshake mode — MockServer's INBOUND TLS handshake cost, which the
#       https_h2 regression run reuses-away to ~0. k6 hits three DISTINCT SUTs with
#       noConnectionReuse (a fresh TCP+TLS handshake every iteration): TLS 1.3
#       server-only (the main SUT), mTLS-required, and native-provider-absent (the
#       Dockerfile's documented JDK-provider fallback, forced via
#       -Dio.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true — nothing else exercises it under
#       load). Emits a .tls_handshake object; this step augments each arm with
#       server CPU + JVM allocation per handshake, sampled per-SUT across the run.
# BEST-EFFORT / NON-FATAL (like the laptop profile): a proxy/handshake failure must
# never cost the k6/growth result its place in the baseline. Both blocks default to
# {} and compare is head-driven, so an absent block simply emits zero metrics.

#   - inter-token delay error: a tiny single-threaded reader
#     (tools/sse-fidelity-reader.py) times consecutive `data:` lines. Run IDLE (the
#     match_baseline phase, no streams open — the client-jitter FLOOR / positive
#     control) and again UNDER LOAD (the stream-load phase). The idle floor proves
#     any error growth is the SERVER (scheduler-thread starvation delaying the
#     per-token writeEvent tasks), not the reader — the reader is identical and
#     unloaded in both. Reported as a DISTRIBUTION (p50/p95/p99), never a mean:
#     the failure mode is a fat TAIL while the median stays on time.
#   - heap per open stream: the heap FLOOR (min jvm_memory_used_bytes{area=heap}
#     over a window, the post-GC saw-tooth valley) with the streams open, minus the
#     idle floor, over the concurrency. INCLUDES the streaming log-ring retention

    # 300 WAS past the knee and measured 8.0x and 3.9x — until 3d7a2f9c8 ("stop
    # keeping a parsed copy of every logged JSON body") cut retained heap per log
    # entry by roughly 7x (429 MB -> 61 MB over 20,000 entries; 1,840,013 Jackson
    # tree nodes -> 0). Far less allocation means far less GC competing with the two
    # action-handler threads, which moved the knee well beyond 300: the first
    # post-fix CI run (build 290) read a match A/B ratio of 1.056 at concurrency 300
    # — a control proving nothing. The product got faster and the calibration went
    # stale; that is the ONLY reason this number changed.
    #
    # 600 is measured ON CI, which is what makes it trustworthy. The laptop curve
    # (~2.0 at 300, ~2.6 at 600, ~4.5 at 900, min 6.08 at 1200) led to a default of
    # 1200 via an extrapolation that turned out to be WRONG IN SHAPE: CI was assumed
    # to need MORE concurrency than a laptop for the same ratio, because at 300 CI
    # read 1.056 where the laptop read ~2.0. In fact CI has a far SHARPER knee — the
    # laptop's own contention had flattened its curve. Measured on CI:
    #     300  -> 1.056  (below the knee; the control proved nothing)
    #     600  -> 2.536  (just past it — where the design wants to sit)
    #     1200 -> 93.8   (deep in collapse, ~40x past the knee)
    #
    # THE KNEE IS BOX-DEPENDENT, which is exactly why the CI figure governs: those figures come from a developer laptop, where the same concurrency
    # 300 read ~2.0 against CI's 1.056 on identical code. A 1-CPU quota buys
    # different real throughput on a dedicated CI core than on a contended laptop
    # vCPU, so CI needs MORE concurrency than the laptop for the same ratio. 1200
    # was chosen because even at the worst observed box sensitivity (CI reading
    # about half the laptop at matched concurrency) it still extrapolates to ~3x,
    # clear of the ~1.6x near-knee band; 900 would not survive that.

# --- item 13: clustered state under load (within-run A/B) ---------------------
# The StateBackend SPI + Infinispan backend move expectation reads and event-log
# writes onto a network for the central deployment the owner named; no number
# existed for what that costs. This block runs regression.js UNCHANGED against two
# targets IN THE SAME RUN and records the per-arm RATIO (clustered / control):
#
#   control  : ONE MockServer, stateBackend=memory   (the default InMemory backend)
#   candidate: TWO MockServers, stateBackend=infinispan + clusterEnabled=true,
#              sharing state over a JGroups TCP/TCPPING transport (REPL_SYNC)
#
# BOTH targets run the SAME clustered image (PERF_CLUSTERED_IMAGE), so the ONLY
# variable between the arms is the backend — the CandidateIndexBenchmark within-run
# A/B discipline the plan names as the repo's gold standard: the ratio cancels
# host / JVM / GC / image noise almost entirely, which is why .clustered_state
# rides the FULL baseline (NOT the k6 arm-set fingerprint or the image digest) in
# perf-test-compare.sh.
#
# REUSE, DON'T REBUILD: PERF_CLUSTERED_IMAGE defaults to the snapshot-clustered
# image, which java-docker-push-snapshot.sh publishes on every master merge from
# the SAME shaded jar, the SAME commit and the SAME job as the SUT image — so it is
# PULLED here (up front, beside the SUT pull), never built. Locally point it at the
# container-tests `integration_testing_clustered` image, which is assembled from the
# SAME clustered-libs jars the container-tests pipeline already builds (netty fat
# jar + /libs/* = Infinispan + JGroups), and set
# PERF_CLUSTERED_REQUIRE_MATCHING_REVISION=false because that image carries no
# revision label. We do NOT build Infinispan a second time here, and we do NOT run
# Maven on the measurement box — a multi-module reactor build on the serialized perf
# agent immediately before measuring would perturb the very thing being measured.
#
# WHAT THE HOT PATH ACTUALLY TOUCHES (why the ratio is what it is): seedRegression
# seeds every expectation with times:{unlimited:true}, so there is NO per-request
# Times CAS (clusterSharedTimesEnabled fires only on a bounded Times). Matching
# reads hit each node's LOCAL compiled-matcher cache (reconciled via invalidation),
# not a network read per request, and the event log is node-local. So the per-
# request network cost for this read/forward/template mix is ~zero; what the ratio
# captures is the STEADY-STATE overhead of running the clustered stack on the
# request path (Infinispan on the classpath, background JGroups FD_ALL3 heartbeats
# + STABLE gossip stealing a little CPU) plus the one-time seed replication. That
# is the honest, useful answer for the central deployment: how far a node's per-
# request latency moves merely by being a clustered member.
#
# RETENTION (the OOM lesson): the count-bounded event-log ring holds FULL bodies,
# residence = maxLogEntries / total_ACHIEVED_rps (LONGER, without bound, as achieved
# throughput falls). k6 drives ONLY the entry node (control, or cluster node A), so
# ONLY that node's ring fills with request bodies — exactly like the main SUT, and it
# gets the SAME PERF_CLUSTERED_MEMORY (2 GB default -> 1.0 GiB heap,
# maxLogEntries ~= 128,500). The per-arm rate x residence x body figures
# (large_10mb@0.1rps -> ~172 MB, large_1mb@0.5rps -> ~86 MB,
# large-4KB@200rps -> ~137 MB) hold ONLY at residence ~172 s; they run away as this node
# contends. So the clustered nodes get the SAME maxEventLogSizeInBytes body-byte OOM
# guard (start_clu, above) as the main SUT, which caps total retained body bytes
# regardless of residence — and applies identically on control and cluster, so it does
# not bias the ratio. The
# SECOND node (B) receives NO request load, so its ring stays ~empty; it holds only
# the seeded expectation set (tiny, seeded once) + bounded JGroups buffers (UFC/MFC
# 2M each, NAKACK2/UNICAST3 send/recv, FRAG2 60K — single-digit MB). REPL_SYNC
# replicates only expectation/scenario WRITES, of which there are ~none after the
# one-time seed, so node B never accumulates bodies. The clustered arm therefore
# adds no retention risk beyond the control's, per node.
#
# BEST-EFFORT / NOTIFY-ONLY like streaming/laptop: a failure defaults the block to
# {} and never costs the k6/growth result its baseline place. BUT — item 8's lesson
# — an empty block must not read as both "off" and "broken". So `clustered_attempted`
# turns true ONLY once the clustered image is present and we start forming the
# cluster; from then a cluster that forms but produces nothing (view < 2, state did
# not cross, or a null ratio) makes the `clustered_metrics_present` validity check
# FALSE and REDS the build (loud), while PERF_CLUSTERED=false or an absent image
# stays a green skip.
#
# WHY A SKIP IS NOW A REAL SIGNAL: the clustered image is published on every master
# merge and pulled up front, so it SHOULD be present on every run. A skip therefore
# means something broke (the publish, the pull, or the commit pairing) rather than
# "not wired yet", and `clustered_skip_reason` names WHICH — it rides the result so
# the compare annotation can say why instead of guessing "probably not published".

# metrics pipeline + Go GC) and cannot saturate the widened client core pool, so
# its clean ceiling is a property of the k6 RIG, not the server. This profile drives
# the SAME offered-rate ladder from N INDEPENDENT k6 processes pinned to DISJOINT
# cores and reports the AGGREGATE client-sound ceiling per process-count, plus a
# scaling verdict that discriminates a per-process CLIENT limit (aggregate ceiling
# rises with N) from a SHARED-PATH / server limit (ceiling flat vs N). It is the
# instrument the programme owes for "a client rig that can saturate the server".
# DEFAULT OFF (opt-in): like serving_percore it spins up and tears down its OWN

# assert_cpusets_physically_disjoint guard above (which governs only the main SUT vs
# k6). It pins by LOGICAL cpu id and its feasibility counts LOGICAL cpus, so unlike
# the main guard it does not prove the client blocks land on physical cores disjoint
# from the SUT's — see the header of multi-process-sweep.sh and the perf-budgets.json

# agents REQUIRE IMDSv2. The original UNAUTHENTICATED GET therefore got a 401 on

# `|| echo fallback` never fired, so EVERY stored baseline point carries
# instance_type:"" (confirmed on runs/master/2026-09-10T04-15-15Z__42193bc4f6.json).
# The whole series has been unqualified by hardware since inception, invisibly,
# because the failure wrote a falsy value at exit 0 — exactly the defect item 0's
# control exists to catch.
#
# The fix is the IMDSv2 two-step: PUT /latest/api/token for a short-lived session
# token, then the metadata GET carrying it in X-aws-ec2-metadata-token. Then VALIDATE
# the body against the EC2 instance-type SHAPE and FAIL CLOSED when it is neither a
# plausible IMDS value NOR an explicitly-declared PERF_INSTANCE_TYPE override (the
# off-EC2 escape hatch — a deliberate human declaration, recorded as source
# "declared"). An unattributable hardware label must be a loud red, never a green run
# carrying a placeholder into the baseline history. `[[ =~ ]]` anchors the WHOLE
# string, so a multi-line mangled body (an HTML/JSON error page) cannot slip a
