# Buildkite step wrapper that turns the CI-agnostic release-preflight PERFORMANCE
# gate (scripts/release/check-perf-preflight.sh) into a hard release gate.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER (same split as check-release-credentials.sh)
#   The probe is deliberately CI-agnostic: it reads env vars, reads S3 + the
#   committed budget file, and emits an exit code — no buildkite-agent calls (see
#   docs/operations/release-principles.md #1). This wrapper adds the two CI-specific
#   concerns the probe leaves out: (1) making sure the checkout has enough git
#   history for the ancestry-based RECENCY check, and (2) turning a non-zero outcome
#   into an actionable red build with a Buildkite annotation naming the outcome.
#
# WHICH QUEUE — the `perf` queue, NOT `release`.
#   The gate reads s3://mockserver-ci-perf-results, whose IAM grant lives on the
#   `perf` queue role (the same grant perf-test-compare.sh uses; see
#   terraform/buildkite-agents and the note in perf-baseline-freshness.sh). The
#   `release` queue holds the mockserver-release/* publishing grants but NOT the
#   perf-results read grant. Running this gate anywhere without that grant fails
#   CLOSED as S3_DENIED (exit 3) — a loud block, never a false green — which is the
#   correct direction, but the intended home is the `perf` queue where it simply works.
#
# EXIT-CODE CONTRACT — inherited verbatim from the probe; this wrapper never
# rewrites a pass into a fail or a fail into a pass, it only annotates and propagates:
#   0   valid + not-stale + no unaccepted gating breach       -> gate PASS
#   1   a FINDING (INVALID / STALE / DIVERGENT / BREACH / NO_HISTORY) -> gate FAIL
#   2   INDETERMINATE / MALFORMED (could not conclude)         -> gate FAIL (fail-closed)
#   3   NO_SESSION / S3_DENIED (nothing could be read)         -> gate FAIL (see note)
#   64  bad probe arguments                                    -> gate FAIL (wiring bug)
#
# NOT soft_fail: a release gate that cannot fail the build is decoration. This is
# the gate where "we shipped a 2x slowdown" is meant to be caught.
