# docker/Dockerfile with --build-arg source=copy, staging whatever it finds at
# mockserver/mockserver-netty/target/mockserver-netty-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
# docker/Dockerfile is the public download-mode REFERENCE image: its source=download
# path fetches the DEFAULT fat jar from Maven Central, and its jarprep stage trims it and
# ASSERTS default-fat-jar native contents (this arch's tcnative and stock-named epoll).
# For the copy smoke test to exercise what the download path ships, it MUST be fed the
# SAME artifact: the default mockserver-netty jar-with-dependencies.
#
# NOT the shaded mockserver-netty-no-dependencies jar: jarprep would detect it as shaded
# (relocated netty, no tcnative) and skip the tcnative assertion. That jar is what
# docker/local consumes, exercised by java-docker-push-snapshot.sh, not here. This
# matches how helm-integration-test.sh already stages the default fat jar for docker/clustered.
