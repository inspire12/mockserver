# Run the mockserver-testcontainers Node suite against a real MockServer
# container started via Testcontainers.
#
# WHY THIS STEP ASSERTS EXPLICITLY (fail closed)
#
#   The integration test (tests/integration) starts a real mockserver/mockserver
#   container and hits it over HTTP, but it returns EARLY — a green Jest pass —
#   when Docker is unavailable (matching the repo's assumeTrue(isDockerAvailable())
#   convention). That graceful skip is correct off-CI, but in CI a skip that reads
#   as green is exactly the silent false positive the Java/Go/.NET/Rust
#   testcontainer steps exist to remove: `npm test` alone can exit 0 having started
#   NO container.
#
#   So this step mounts the Docker socket, runs the integration suite, captures its
#   output, and greps for the NODE_TESTCONTAINERS_STATUS_OK marker the test prints
#   only after a real container answered PUT /mockserver/status with 200. If the
#   marker is absent — the test was filtered out, renamed, or Docker was unusable —
#   the step fails loudly instead of passing green.
