# WHY THIS IS HERE AND WHY `bash -n` IS NOT ENOUGH.
#
# These scripts embed jq programs as single-quoted bash strings. A possessive in
# a comment INSIDE such a program -- k6's, pool's, the sweep's -- closes the
# string early. If a second one appears later it re-opens it, so the file's
# quoting stays BALANCED and `bash -n` reports it valid. jq then receives
# mangled text and the step dies at that line mid-run.
#
# Build 347 is the worked example: perf-percore.sh carried k6's and pool's on
# adjacent comment lines inside the result-assembly jq program. bash -n passed,
# an authoritative review passed, and the per-core ladder still died with
#   syntax error near unexpected token `$sweep[0].vus_diagnostics'
# AFTER the ladder had run -- so item 18's curve was lost while every check was
# green.
#
# SC1073/SC1072 DO catch it -- verified against that exact broken file, and
# clean on the fixed one -- so the guard is a mature parser rather than a bespoke
# one. (A first attempt here was a hand-written quote-state tracker; it could not
# model command substitution inside double quotes and produced both false
# positives and a false negative, which is a worse guard than none.) -S error
# keeps this to parse-level breakage and will not fail the build on style.
