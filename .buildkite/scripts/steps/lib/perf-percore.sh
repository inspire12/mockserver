# perf-percore.sh — req/s per core for the SERVING path (performance-programme
# item 18). Emits a self-describing `serving_percore` JSON block (stdout, or the
# file named by $1) that perf-test-run.sh merges into result.json under
# `.serving_percore` and copies out as the `serving-percore.json` artifact.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES (and how it differs from the injector per-core curve).
# `inject-percore.json` (perf-test-inject.sh, chart_inject_percore) is the
# per-core ceiling of the LOAD GENERATOR. This is its mirror for the SERVER: pin
# ONE MockServer SUT to C cores, drive the sweep ladder against it from a k6 on
# DISJOINT cores, and record, per C:
#   * rig_valid_peak_achieved_rps — max achieved over RIG-VALID rungs (client had CPU
#                           headroom, no dropped iterations, low errors). This is
#                           the SAME rig-valid peak definition perf-test-run.sh's
#                           saturation block uses; a rung where k6 (not the SUT)
#                           was the bottleneck is EXCLUDED, or the C-point would
#                           measure the injector, not the serving path.
#   * healthy_ceiling_rps — the highest rung where achieved stayed >= keep*offered
#                           with ZERO errors AND p50 within lat_mult x the flat-
#                           region p50. This is NOT re-implemented here: each C's
#                           sweep is fed as a synthetic run to the ONE authoritative
#                           implementation, lib/perf-website-figures.jq (Finding 1;
#                           the same definition render_perf_charts.py carries), and
#                           .headline.healthy_ceiling_rps is read back out. Reusing
#                           the filter, not copying its arithmetic, is deliberate:
#                           the programme forbids a third divergent copy of the
#                           ceiling rule.
#   * rps_per_core        — healthy_ceiling_rps / C. The HEALTHY ceiling, not the
#                           degraded peak, is the honest "req/s per core you can
#                           actually serve". (peak_per_core is also emitted.)
#
# THE C=16 PREREQUISITE (item 18 calls it easy to miss). At C=16 the SUT wants 16
# cores and the k6 client needs its OWN disjoint cores, so the rung is only
# feasible on a box with >=16 + K6_MIN_CORES cores. On anything smaller the curve
# STOPS at the largest feasible C and SAYS SO: every requested-but-infeasible C is
# recorded in `.serving_percore.skipped[]` with a reason, and `max_cores_measured`
# / `curve_complete_to_16` make the limit explicit in the artifact and annotation.
# A ladder that silently ends early reads as "measured to 16" to a skimmer — so it
# must never silently end early.
#
# PINNING (item 17's lever, reconfirmed here). `--cpuset-cpus` is the reliable
# pin: it changes what the container's JVM sees via Runtime.availableProcessors(),
# which sizes actionHandlerThreadCount()=max(5,availableProcessors()) and the pools
# derived from it. `--cpus` (CFS quota) does NOT surface in the processor count, so
# it would leave the pools sized for the whole host — not what we mean to measure.
# We PROVE the pin took: for each C a one-shot probe container on the IDENTICAL
# image and cpuset prints availableProcessors (recorded as .available_processors);
# same image runtime + same cgroup cpuset as the SUT, so it is definitionally the
# count the SUT's own JVM computed. A C whose probe != C fails the run loudly.
#
# WARM-UP IS BIAS, NOT NOISE. Before each measured sweep a short warm-up drive
# runs (never measured), so the sweep's first rung is not paying JIT/first-touch
# cost. The warm-up's own p50 and the first vs second rung p50 are recorded under
# .warmup so a reader can SEE the transient was removed rather than averaged in.
#
# EVENT-LOG RETENTION, PER RUNG. MockServer keeps full request/response bodies in
# a COUNT-bounded ring (maxLogEntries), so retained bytes ~ maxLogEntries x body
# is roughly CONSTANT with rate, but an entry's RESIDENCE time = maxLogEntries /
# achieved_rps LENGTHENS as throughput falls. At C=1 the SUT is slow, so residence
# is long — the arithmetic is done PER RUNG (.ladder[].retention_residence_s), not
# once. maxLogEntries has no metrics endpoint, so it is an ASSUMED input
# (PERF_PERCORE_MAX_LOG_ENTRIES, honestly labelled `retention.assumed_max_log_entries`).
#
# NON-GATING. Every serving_percore.* metric is notify-only (see perf-budgets.json
# and perf-test-compare.sh). This harness only measures; it never fails a build on
# a throughput number.
#
# HARDWARE MATRIX MODE (item 27): PERF_PERCORE_MODE=hw_matrix runs the same procedure
# over PERF_HW_MATRIX ("cores:memory[:control]") and emits `serving_hw_matrix`. Each point
# also sets a container memory limit (no swap, no -Xmx, as in a user's container) and
# records resolved heap/log bounds, peak memory, OOM state and any lower-bound reasons.
# By default (PERF_HW_MATRIX_CLIENT=multik6) each point is driven by
# mockserver-performance-test/scripts/rw-multi-k6-sweep.sh against that point's SUT, from one
# fixed client placement, and its rig validity and lower-bound reasons come from derive_saturation
# (lib/perf-hw-matrix-rw.jq), not the single-k6 85%-of-pin rule below.
# Each hw_matrix SUT also writes a GC log (PERF_HW_MATRIX_GC_LOG, default true) and takes
# PERF_HW_MATRIX_SUT_JAVA_OPTS, both appended to the image's own JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS; the sampler
# records GC time, event-log drops/evictions and the SUT cgroup's memory.events and PSI, which
# each multik6 point summarises per rung steady window (.rung_jvm, <point dir>/jvm-rungs.json).

# a server whose true ceiling is 7,900 rps reported 4,000.

# ladder, so the old default would have reported 4000 again: a 50% understatement of the same
