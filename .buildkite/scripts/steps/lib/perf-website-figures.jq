# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Transform ONE self-describing perf run (schema_version >= 2, produced by
# .buildkite/scripts/steps/perf-test-run.sh) into the PUBLISHABLE figures the
# website renders from jekyll-www.mock-server.com/_data/perf_figures.json.
#
# This filter decides WHAT reaches the public page. It deliberately publishes
# ONLY the two families the performance programme has cleared as honest,
# absolute, customer-facing claims:
#
#   * the throughput/latency knee curve, with healthy_ceiling_rps as the
#     headline and peak_achieved_rps beside it EXPLICITLY labelled degraded
#     (docs/plans/performance-programme.md, Finding 1); and
#   * per-behaviour percentiles from the FIXED regression.js (Finding 3,
#     resolved 2026-09-16) — emitted only when the run actually carries them.
#
# It NEVER emits the internal-only regression detectors the plan marks
# "gated internally, never published": the JMH absolute backstops, growth/soak
# live-set slope and absolute, event-log verification cost, forward-pool guard,
# AppCDS boolean, leak gate, the streaming match-A/B ratio (an A/B tripwire
# measured against a DELIBERATELY constrained 1-CPU SUT — misleading as an
# absolute public figure), the startup median-of-9, and the baseline-freshness
# assertion. Those metrics exist to move under regression, not to be quoted.
#
# healthy_ceiling_rps is computed here to Finding 1's definition — the highest
# offered rung where achieved stayed within (1 - keep) of offered, errors were
# zero, AND p50 stayed within lat_mult x the flat-region p50 — rather than
# trusting the run's own saturation_rps, so a reader can see exactly which rung
# it is and that latency was still flat there.
#
# Args (all via --argjson / --arg):
#   $now       ISO-8601 timestamp to stamp as published_utc
#   $lat_mult  latency multiple defining "still flat" (default caller: 3)
#   $keep      achieved/offered floor for a healthy rung (default caller: 0.95)
#   p99_max_ms OPTIONAL (read via $ARGS.named): also require p99 <= this many ms. Unset =
#              p50-only, the published rule. Only the multi-k6 arm (rw-multi-k6-sweep.sh) sets
#              it; see docs/code/performance-measurement.md ("The multi-k6 arm's p99 bound").
#
# The caller (perf-website-publish.sh) is responsible for REFUSING to publish a
# run whose sweep is missing/invalid (headline null); this filter only shapes a
# run it is given. behaviours is null when the run carries none — the page
# renders the behaviours section only when it is present.

# null-safe: a rung without a percentile (e.g. a multi-process rung with too few samples for a
# tail) must publish as null, not abort the whole transform.
