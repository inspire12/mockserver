#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The physical-core DISJOINTNESS proof used to live inline in
# perf-test-run.sh, guarding only the main SUT / upstream / k6 pinning. The
# multi-process client rig (mockserver-performance-test/scripts/multi-process-sweep.sh)
# pins its own SUT and N client blocks by LOGICAL cpu id, and at higher process
# counts a client block can cross onto the hyperthread SIBLINGS of the server's
# cores — silently putting the load generator inside the system under test and
# reporting the result as a SERVER ceiling. That is exactly the defect the main
# guard was written to stop ("the load generator has been sharing the server's
# physical cores all along") and the whole justification for the hardware resize.
# So the proof is factored HERE, ONE implementation, sourced by BOTH callers, and
# generalised over an arbitrary list of role/spec pairs — the two callers cannot
# drift, and there is no second copy of the topology parsing to rot.
#
# This file only DEFINES functions (no side effects), so it is safe to `source`
# under `set -euo pipefail`.

# logical ids — two hyperthread siblings are ONE core). Returns:
#   0  disjoint; OR topology unreadable OFF-CI (a limitation, not a fault — the
#      caller still runs, the numbers are just labelled unverifiable).
#   1  (FAIL THE RUN) two cpusets share a physical core; OR a non-empty spec expands
#      to nothing (a reversed/malformed range that would otherwise narrow the check
#      silently); OR the args are not role/spec pairs; OR topology unreadable IN CI
#      (BUILDKITE=true) — an unprovable benchmark is the thing this guard stops.
# An EMPTY spec is skipped (a role may legitimately be unpinned), never treated as
# "no overlap proven".
#
# Two historical defects of the original inline guard are deliberately avoided here,
# both of the class it targets (a guard that fails for the wrong reason, or passes
# because it examined nothing):
#   * NO `local -A`. Associative arrays need bash 4; macOS ships bash 3.2, where the
#     array form is a syntax ERROR — the guard would die instead of checking. The
#     seen-cores set is a newline-separated "<core key> <role>" table scanned with awk.
#   * A non-empty spec that expands to NOTHING is FATAL, not skipped — otherwise a
#     reversed range ("13-8") would quietly drop a role from the check while the rest
#     reported disjoint.
