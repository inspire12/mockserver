# Fail closed if the HTTP/3 (QUIC) integration suite silently skipped.
#
# The Http3*IntegrationTest suites (mockserver-netty) are Failsafe ITs, so the
# main build's `clean install` already runs them in the verify phase — they need
# NO Docker socket, only the native QUIC (BoringSSL) transport, which is bundled
# in the mockserver/mockserver:maven image (Quic.isAvailable() is true on its
# linux-x86_64 JVM). That is WHY this is asserted here over the reports the main
# build already produced, rather than in a dedicated re-run step like the
# socket-gated async/cloud/testcontainers suites: those DON'T run in the main
# build (no socket) so they need their own step; http3 DOES, so re-running it
# would only duplicate the largest module's build and risk a new flaky red.
#
# But each suite is guarded by `Assume.assumeTrue(Quic.isAvailable())` and skips
# gracefully when the native cannot load — so if a future change (native stripped
# from the image/uber-jar, an unsupported agent arch, a netty classifier break)
# made QUIC unavailable, every http3 test would SKIP and the build would stay
# green having tested no HTTP/3 at all. assert-suite-ran.sh turns that silent skip
# into a loud failure (it also fails if the reports are absent, i.e. the suite did
# not run at all). Only checked on a green build (rc==0): a failed build is
# already red, and piling a report-absence error on top would only obscure the
# real cause. When the netty integration tests run in the shard steps instead
# (MOCKSERVER_NETTY_ITS_IN_SHARDS), the rest shard makes this check.
