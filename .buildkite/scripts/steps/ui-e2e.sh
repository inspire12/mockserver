# Dashboard end-to-end tests: drive the SERVED dashboard in a real browser
# (headless Chromium via Playwright) against a REAL MockServer over real REST and
# a real WebSocket — the browser-level backstop the jsdom/vitest suite cannot
# provide. Covers every dashboard area (Mock, Observe, Verify, Resilience,
# Library / Inspect, the shell) against the live control plane and the live
# WebSocket log stream.
#
# Runs two Playwright suites: the served-dashboard suite described below, and
# the Panel scroll-anchoring regression, which drives the real Panel +
# ProgressiveList over its own Vite harness and needs no server.
#
# Hard CI gate — a failure in EITHER blocks master (fail-closed: Playwright exits
# non-zero on any failure AND when zero tests are found, and in CI the
# no-silent-skip reporter fails the run if any test skips other than a
# test.fixme for a known open defect).
#
# Topology (same-origin, mirroring how a user runs the dashboard; identical to a
# local `npm run test:e2e`):
#   1. Build the CURRENT runnable JAR (the build-ui Maven profile bundles the
#      current UI source into it) using the Maven CI image.
#   2. Stage a JRE from the Temurin image into the workspace, because the
#      Playwright image has none.
#   3. Run the Playwright image (Chromium bundled). Its config boots the JAR
#      itself inside that container (e2e/start-mockserver.mjs): the main server
#      under test and a secondary server (proxied upstream, metrics on), and the
#      observe spec boots a short-lived third one. Everything is on 127.0.0.1, so
#      a server can forward to an upstream the test runner itself listens on.
