# Dashboard end-to-end tests: drive the SERVED dashboard in a real browser
# (headless Chromium via Playwright) against a REAL MockServer over real REST and
# a real WebSocket — the browser-level backstop the jsdom/vitest suite cannot
# provide. Covers dashboard-driven expectation CRUD against the live control
# plane and the live WebSocket log stream.
#
# Runs two Playwright suites: the served-dashboard suite described below, and
# the Panel scroll-anchoring regression, which drives the real Panel +
# ProgressiveList over its own Vite harness and needs no server.
#
# Hard CI gate — a failure in EITHER blocks master (fail-closed: Playwright exits
# non-zero on any failure AND when zero tests are found).
#
# Topology (same-origin, mirroring how a user runs the dashboard):
#   1. Build the CURRENT runnable JAR (the build-ui Maven profile bundles the
#      current UI source into it) using the Maven CI image.
#   2. Run that JAR in a JRE container on a private Docker network — it serves the
#      dashboard, the /mockserver/* control plane, and the WebSocket, all on one
#      origin.
#   3. Run the Playwright image (Chromium bundled) on the same network, pointed at
#      the server container (E2E_EXTERNAL_SERVER=1 so Playwright does NOT try to
#      boot its own JVM).
