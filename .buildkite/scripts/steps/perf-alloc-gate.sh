# PER-MERGE allocation backstop (performance-programme item 16).
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT: runs the three JMH ALLOCATION benchmarks at PINNED representative params
# — MatchingBenchmark (matching), InboundDecodeBenchmark (request decode),
# ResponseWriteBenchmark (response serialise + write) — captures each one's
# gc.alloc.rate.norm (bytes/op), and FAILS the build if any exceeds its ABSOLUTE
# committed floor in mockserver-performance-test/perf-budgets.json
# (premerge_alloc.<Class>.alloc_bytes_per_op). A row whose budget lacks
# `gating: true` is NOTIFY-ONLY: a breach is annotated as a warning, not a failure.
# Every row still needs a numeric floor — a missing budget fails closed either way.
#
# WHY it is separate from the daily perf-test-microbench.sh + perf-test-compare.sh:
#   * Coverage. MatchingBenchmark alone measures MATCHING only — not Netty decode
#     or response serialisation/write. An allocation regression that moves bytes
#     OUT of the matcher and INTO decode/response-write reads as an IMPROVEMENT
#     against a matcher-only gate. Adding the decode + response-write arms with
#     absolute floors makes "bytes moved into decode/write" trip a floor.
#   * Absolute, not rolling. The daily compare uses a rolling median + MAD over
#     per-merge history, which ABSORBS the slow drift the gate exists to catch. A
#     committed absolute floor cannot be normalised down by a quiet window.
#   * Per merge is a property of WIRING. This step is wired UNCONDITIONALLY into
#     .buildkite/pipeline-java.yml (no `if: build.branch == 'master'`), BEFORE the
#     `wait` that precedes the master-gated block, so it runs PRE-merge and blocks
#     the PR. A branch-conditioned step, or one in the master-only container suite,
#     would silently be a POST-merge gate. (Note: pipeline-java.yml is itself
#     orchestrator-path-filtered to mockserver/ + mockserver-ui/ changes, so a JDK
#     or base-image bump that shifts allocation reaches this gate only via the
#     daily run — this step does NOT cover that class of change.)
#
# gc.alloc.rate.norm is bytes allocated per op, independent of CPU speed, so an
# absolute regression here is trustworthy on cloud CI. It is stable within a fork,
# but a JIT escape-analysis outcome can differ ACROSS forks (the HEADERS_MISS
# rows are multimodal on amd64), so a floor must clear every mode. Some floors
# are PROVISIONAL (see perf-budgets.json): derived from local measurement with
# headroom rather than from >=10 notify-only runs, because these benchmarks have
# no history yet. ResponseWrite is ALSO promoted notify-only into the daily
# microbench step so history accrues and the floors can graduate.
#
# Heavy (builds mockserver-netty + upstream reactor deps, then forks a JVM per
# benchmark), same prep as perf-test-microbench.sh. Runs on the default queue.
#
# LOCAL / TEST HOOK: set PERF_ALLOC_JMH_RESULT to a pre-produced JMH -rf json to
# skip the Docker build+run and only evaluate that file against the floors. Used
# by the degrade-and-confirm-red verification and for fast local iteration.

# The three allocation benchmarks and the params that pin each to a DETERMINISTIC
# row count. MatchingBenchmark reads matcherType/expectationCount/logLevel AND
# detailedMatchFailures; InboundDecode reads bodySize; ResponseWrite reads
# responseSize AND declareBodyCharset. JMH applies each -p only to the benchmarks
# that declare it. EVERY param a benchmark declares must be pinned here: an
# UNPINNED param is expanded over ALL its declared values, which multiplies that
# class's row count non-deterministically and breaks the EXPECTED_ROWS assertion
# below (fail-closed, but a red build rather than a measurement).
#
# MatchingBenchmark's detailedMatchFailures is pinned to BOTH values
# (`false,true`) DELIBERATELY — the gate measures and floors each arm separately:
#   * The `false` arm is the detailedMatchFailures opt-out; its committed floor
#     (premerge_alloc.MatchingBenchmark.alloc_bytes_per_op) was derived from that
#     non-detailed shape and MUST keep describing it.
#   * The `true` arm is the SHIPPED DEFAULT (detailedMatchFailures defaults to true)
#     and exercises the MatchDifference -> StringFormatter formatting
#     path a sustained-load JFR profile found to be the #1/#2 production allocation
#     sites (~28-33% of sampled allocation), made lazy by a8898b263. Left
#     un-measured, a regression re-introducing eager formatting would sail straight
#     through this gate. It is routed to its OWN key
#     (premerge_alloc.MatchingBenchmark_detailed.alloc_bytes_per_op) by evaluate()
#     below, so the two arms never share a floor.
# `false,true` is an EXPLICIT two-value pin (a comma list), NOT an open expansion:
# the row count it produces is exactly known (2), so the EXPECTED_ROWS guard stays
# deterministic. declareBodyCharset is pinned to `false` for the same
# floor-describes-its-own-workload reason (ResponseWrite's floor came from the
# implicit-charset shape; the explicit arm is measured by perf-test-microbench.sh).
#
# Pinned-run row count: MatchingBenchmark 1x1x1x{false,true}=2 + InboundDecode 1 + ResponseWrite
# 1x1 = 4 rows.
