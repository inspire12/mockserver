# --- items 9b + 9c: proxy-path benchmarks -------------------------------------
# The largest genuinely uncovered area the mandate names (performance-programme
# item 9). Two JMH classes, promoted here so they emit through the SAME notify-only
# microbench_extra path as the item-15b dark set (the existing
# `microbench_extra.*.{time_per_op,alloc_bytes_per_op}` budgets cover them with NO
# new budget key; time_per_op carries hw:true, alloc_bytes_per_op does not — the
# correct classification, since a relayed-byte timing moves with the box but
# bytes/op is machine-independent):
#   9c RelayByteCopyBenchmark  — the CONNECT/relay response leg (decode -> relay
#      aggregator -> re-encode); the matcher backstop says nothing about a byte-copy-
#      dominated path.
#   9b SocksHandshakeBenchmark — the per-connection SOCKS4/5 handshake codecs (the
#      plan's sanctioned downgrade from a k6 SOCKS arm: k6 has no SOCKS transport, and
#      the SOCKS steady-state relay is already 9c's territory, so the handshake is the
#      only uncovered SOCKS cost).
# WHY a SEPARATE invocation rather than appending both to JMH_INCLUDE_EXTRA:
#   (1) COST. Their full default @Param cartesians are RelayByteCopy 2x3x4=24 +
#       Socks 3x3=9 = 33 combos. At the guard's own ~1 min/combo-on-the-box budget
#       (see perf-test-guard.sh) that ~doubles the extra set and blows the 70m step
#       cap. A daily regression trend needs ONE representative cell per method, not
#       the full characterisation sweep (the same reason the PRIMARY MatchingBenchmark
#       run pins -p expectationCount=100). The full sweeps stay available on demand via
#       the benchmarks' own run.sh (documented in each class's javadoc).
#   (2) PARAM COLLISION. JMH_ARGS_EXTRA is shared and UNPINNED; adding `-p bodySize=...`
#       there would ALSO pin InboundDecodeBenchmark (which has a bodySize @Param),
#       collapsing its 3 rows to 1 and half-dropping that gated-adjacent metric. A
#       dedicated args string keeps the pin off the shared classes.
# The pinned cell: relay at a 256 KiB body fed in 1460-byte (MTU-sized) fragments — a
# ~180-fragment large-response relay, where the per-fragment object churn 9c measures
# is clearly visible and a regression would move alloc_bytes_per_op; SOCKS5_PASSWORD —
# the heaviest handshake (greeting + password-auth + command, two decoder swaps), with
# its own two controls (detect = allocation-free front-door floor; channelPlumbingOnly
# = the per-op EmbeddedChannel construction share) riding along for free. JMH applies
# each -p only to the class that declares it (bodySize/readSize -> relay, scenario ->
# socks; the other shows N/A) — verified: the combined invocation exits 0 and emits
# exactly the 5 rows above. Same classpath as the runs above (no extra module build).

# detailedMatchFailures=true row (see the pin note on JMH_ARGS).
#
# Also record the JMH METHODOLOGY under .config.jmh (item 15c baseline-discontinuity

# built under the previous methodology (-f1, 6s warmup). Changing to -f2/4s warmup can
# shift absolute timings, which would flag a SPURIOUS gating regression against a
# differently-measured baseline. perf-test-compare.sh reads this fingerprint and skips
# baseline runs whose .config.jmh differs from the head run's, so a methodology change
# self-invalidates its own baseline (metrics go no-baseline until history repopulates)
# rather than firing a false red. Nested under .config to follow perf-test-run.sh's
# self-describing config block; the jq -s '*' merge in compare deep-merges it beside

# The proxy benchmarks run in their own JVM forks AFTER the primary MatchingBenchmark
# has finished and written jmh-result.json, so they cannot shift the matcher timings,

# needlessly reset the GATING microbench.*.time_per_op matcher baseline (the one real

# rebuild-on-read would move the churn/static allocation ratio ~1.06x -> ~1000x+ (three orders
# of magnitude), which the absolute floor catches. The FAIL-CLOSED guard that a CHURN arm
# actually churned — rather than silently degrading to a static measurement when its daemon
# writer thread dies, which would land the ratio at ~1.0 and pass the 1.5 floor GREEN — is the
# benchmark's OWN @TearDown assertion (it throws on unhealthy churn signals), enforced by JMH
# -foe true so the error exits non-zero and reds THIS step. (run-g1-churn.sh also runs the
