# Run the AsyncAPI live-broker integration suites (Kafka, Kafka+Avro, AMQP,
# MQTT 3.1.1, MQTT 5) against real brokers via Testcontainers.
#
# WHY THIS STEP EXISTS
#
#   The five *LiveBrokerIntegrationTest suites already ran in the main build —
#   Failsafe's **/*IntegrationTest.java include matches them and the main build
#   runs `clean install`, which reaches `verify`. But the main build deliberately
#   has NO Docker socket, so their Assume gate was never satisfied and they
#   SKIPPED EVERY TEST ON EVERY BUILD while the job still went green. Verified
#   from Buildkite: the `:maven: build` job passed (exit 0) in mockserver-java
#   builds #1580 and #1583, each reporting
#
#     failsafe:integration-test @ mockserver-async
#     Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 5
#
#   (Both builds failed overall, on the separate cloud blob-store step — a green
#   job that tested nothing is exactly the false positive removed here.)
#
#   That is the same false positive `java-cloud-store-test.sh` was created to
#   remove for the cloud blob-store suites: a suite being *collected* is not the
#   same as a suite *testing anything*.
#
#   Run locally against real brokers the same five suites execute 24 tests in
#   ~75s wall clock, all passing — so this is cheap and genuinely green, not a
#   gate that needs the suites fixed first.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE STEP rather than `-s` on java-build.sh:
#
#   Identical reasoning to java-cloud-store-test.sh — run-in-docker.sh withholds
#   the Docker socket from PR builds and `exit 0`s the whole step when one is
#   requested. Adding `-s` to java-build.sh would make the ENTIRE Java reactor
#   silently exit 0 on every PR build, trading a narrow false positive for a
#   total one. Splitting keeps the main build socket-free and confines the
#   PR-build socket skip to this module, where it is announced in the log.
#
# WHY TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_CONTAINER_PRIVILEGED=false:
#
#   Carried over from java-cloud-store-test.sh and required here for the same
#   reason — this is the second Testcontainers-Java step on these agents, and the
#   failure is not self-announcing. Testcontainers-Java starts its Ryuk reaper
#   with Privileged=true by default (TestcontainersConfiguration.isRyukPrivileged()
#   defaults `ryuk.container.privileged` to "true"), and the elastic-ci-stack
#   agents run dockerd with user-namespace remapping, which rejects privileged
#   containers outright:
#
#     BadRequestException: Status 400: privileged mode is incompatible with
#     user namespaces...
#
#   Ryuk reaps through the mounted socket and does not need privileged mode, so
#   dropping only that flag keeps container cleanup working. NOTE the exact
#   variable name: Testcontainers maps a property to an env var by uppercasing,
#   replacing dots and prefixing TESTCONTAINERS_, so `ryuk.container.privileged`
#   becomes TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_CONTAINER_PRIVILEGED. The intuitive-looking
#   TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_PRIVILEGED is read by nothing and silently has no effect.
#
# WHY -m 7g AND NOT 4g:
#
#   Same defect, same fix as java-cloud-store-test.sh (see its header for the
#   measurements). `mockserver/.mvn/jvm.config` pins the Maven JVM to
#   `-Xms2048m -Xmx6144m` and mvnw prepends jvm.config to MAVEN_OPTS, so the JVM
#   running the `-am` dependency build below is permitted a 6g heap; under a 4g
#   cgroup the kernel OOM-kills it (exit 137) before any test runs, which
#   silently removes exactly the coverage the assert-suite-ran.sh guard exists to
#   guarantee. 7g matches every other step that runs ./mvnw from mockserver/.
