# WEEKLY soak step (perf queue) — item 10 of the performance programme.
#
# Runs soak.js for a long duration (default 2h) against a MockServer with a
# BOUNDED heap, to surface slow degradation that a 2-minute regression run cannot:
# data-plane p99 DRIFT as the event log fills and stays full, connection/fd leaks
# over hours, and — item 10b — the COST of `verify` / `retrieveRecordedRequests`
# against a FULL log (the central-deployment pattern; an O(n) ring regression
# bites hardest here).
#
# Two INDEPENDENT loud-failure mechanisms (a scheduled-but-silent soak is the
# false green this step is built to prevent):
#   1. k6's own thresholds (p99 drift on op:match, error rate, checks) — a breach
#      makes k6 exit non-zero, which this step propagates -> RED build. THIS is the
#      soak gate.
#   2. a PRESENCE ASSERTION after k6: the soak-result.json must exist AND its
#      match / verify / retrieve arms must each carry samples, AND the SUT must
#      have received enough traffic that the log genuinely filled. A soak that
#      "ran" but produced no 10b measurement fails here, LOUD — it is never a
#      green with an empty result block.
#
# NOTIFY-ONLY otherwise. The soak result is uploaded as its OWN artifact
# (perf-soak.json) and is DELIBERATELY NOT fed to perf-test-compare.sh: no soak
# budget keys exist yet, and the daily compare's fail-closed missing-budget rule
# would red the build on a soak metric it cannot resolve. Soak metrics stay
# notify-only until ~8 weekly runs of variance let a budget be derived (~2
# months).
#
# WHY WEEKLY, OUT OF THE DAILY'S SLOT: a daily regression build can hold every
# perf agent at once, so a 2h soak starting in its 04:00 UTC window would queue
# behind it or delay it. This step is dispatched by a SEPARATE weekly schedule
# (terraform/buildkite-pipelines/pipelines.tf) at a time clear of 04:00 (daily
# regression) and 16:00 (baseline freshness).

# empty event log. This soak runs for two hours against a log that fills its ~128.5k ring in the first
# ~340 s and stays pinned there, so it measures a different subject and the inherited numbers do not
# describe it. Build #340 - the first VALID soak, on the fixed harness - measured the match arm at
# p95 62.644 ms and p99 96.051 ms. The p95 gate therefore reds this build every week on a number
# that was never about this scenario, while p99 "passes" with 4% headroom, which is not a pass so
