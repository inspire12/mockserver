# WEEKLY soak step (perf queue) — item 10 of the performance programme.
#
# Runs soak.js for a long duration (default 2h) against a MockServer with a
# BOUNDED heap, to surface slow degradation that a 2-minute regression run cannot:
# data-plane p99 DRIFT as the event log fills and stays full, connection/fd leaks
# over hours, and — item 10b — the COST of `verify` / `retrieveRecordedRequests`
# against a FULL log (the central-deployment pattern; an O(n) ring regression
# bites hardest here).
#
# Two INDEPENDENT loud-failure mechanisms (a scheduled-but-silent soak is the
# false green this step is built to prevent):
#   1. k6's own thresholds (match p95/p99, error rate, checks) — a breach
#      makes k6 exit non-zero, which this step propagates -> RED build. THIS is the
#      soak gate.
#   2. a PRESENCE ASSERTION after k6: the soak-result.json must exist AND its
#      match / verify / retrieve arms must each carry samples, AND the server's own
#      counters must show the event log reached a bound and evicted. A soak that
#      "ran" but produced no 10b measurement fails here, LOUD — it is never a
#      green with an empty result block.
#
# The step also refuses to measure an image with no usable revision label, and fails
# on a server that stops before it is ready, a server OutOfMemoryError, a dead or
# OOM-killed server container, unreadable server output, or a missing GC log. An image
# that trails the harness commit is measured and recorded as such.
#
# NOTIFY-ONLY otherwise. The soak result is uploaded as its OWN artifact
# (perf-soak.json) and is DELIBERATELY NOT fed to perf-test-compare.sh: no soak
# budget keys exist yet, and the daily compare's fail-closed missing-budget rule
# would red the build on a soak metric it cannot resolve. Soak metrics stay
# notify-only until ~8 weekly runs of variance let a budget be derived (~2
# months).
#
# WHY WEEKLY, OUT OF THE DAILY'S SLOT: a daily regression build can hold every
# perf agent at once, so a 2h soak starting in its 04:00 UTC window would queue
# behind it or delay it. This step is dispatched by a SEPARATE weekly schedule
# (terraform/buildkite-pipelines/pipelines.tf) at a time clear of 04:00 (daily
# regression) and 16:00 (baseline freshness).

# k6/lib/config.js LIMITS is documented as "standard thresholds shared by the load/stress/soak
# scenarios": p95 25 ms, p99 100 ms. Those were calibrated for a SHORT load test against a nearly
# empty event log. This soak runs for two hours against a log that fills its ~115.5k ring in the first
# ~305 s and stays pinned there, so it measures a different subject and the inherited numbers do not
# describe it. Build #340 - the first VALID soak, on the fixed harness - measured the match arm at
# p95 62.644 ms and p99 96.051 ms. The p95 gate therefore reds this build every week on a number
# that was never about this scenario, while p99 "passes" with 4% headroom, which is not a pass so
# much as a coin toss on a contended agent.
#
# These values are PROVISIONAL and derived from a SINGLE valid run, so they are set with enough
# headroom to stop a false weekly red without pretending to be calibrated: roughly 2x the one
# observation each. They are not a licence to regress - a genuine blowout still crosses them.
#
# REPLACE THEM WITH REAL ONES. This step already states the plan: the soak result is withheld from
# the baseline compare "until ~8 weekly runs of variance exist (~2 months)". That same accumulation
# is what these thresholds should be derived from. When it exists, set them from the observed
# distribution and delete this note. Until then the meaningful gates here are the ones this step

# call, which filled maxExpectations and then EVICTED the seeded /simple match
# expectation, so the SUT correctly 404'd most match requests. Every presence
# assertion above PASSED (all arms had samples; the log had filled) while
# three-quarters of the match arm was a 404 — a false-green shape the presence
# checks cannot see. This guard catches exactly it: a HIGH match failure rate
# (http_req_failed, which counts completed non-2xx responses) combined with ~ZERO
# transport errors (requests that never completed) means the SUT was UP and
# ANSWERING but returning non-2xx (almost always 404). A genuinely DOWN SUT shows a
# high transport-error rate instead and is left to the k6 error-rate gate; this
# guard deliberately does NOT fire on that shape.

Read the per-status breakdown in the uploaded partial k6 result before assuming a cause; this guard classifies the SHAPE, it does not diagnose. Two known causes of this shape, in order of likelihood: (1) the harness evicting its own match seed — the build-324 bug, where an unbounded 'create' arm filled maxExpectations and evicted the seeded /simple expectation, giving 404s; check createSimpleExpectation() still uses a stable id and a distinct path (/churn), and do NOT paper over it by raising maxExpectations. (2) the SUT genuinely returning completed 5xx under load, which is a real regression and looks nothing like (1) in the status breakdown."
