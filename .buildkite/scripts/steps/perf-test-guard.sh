# --- OPT-IN: load-injection ceiling + scaling sweep ---------------------------
# The injection step (perf-test-inject.sh) is heavy (multi-instance compose +
# Envoy + a per-N scale sweep, ~60m) and answers a DIFFERENT question from the
# daily regression run — "how much load can MockServer GENERATE", not "how fast
# does it SERVE". So it is NOT part of the standard daily dispatch. It runs only
# when explicitly requested: the `PERF_INJECT` build env is truthy, or the build
# message carries the `[perf-inject]` marker. This keeps the daily commit-gated
# build lean while making the injection sweep one toggle away — and because it is
# independent of the new-commit guard, it can be re-run on the SAME commit.

  # --- DEPENDENCY GRAPH — read before touching the ordering below --------------
  # The measurement steps run in parallel; `persist + compare` (the gating step)
  # and `publish` follow. Ordering is made EXPLICIT with `depends_on` + step
  # `key`s — deliberately NOT a positional `- wait: ~`. WHY:
  #
  #   A plain `- wait: ~` fails CLOSED on ANY prior step's failure. Two of the
  #   parallel steps are NOTIFY-ONLY and go red on a HARNESS self-validation
  #   failure that is explicitly NOT a slowdown (see each step's own comment):
  #     · :microscope: micro-benchmark + scaling sweep
  #     · :racing_car: HTTP/2 multiplex (issue #2669)
  #   Under a `wait`, either one going red SKIPS `persist + compare`, throwing
  #   away an otherwise-valid baseline run. Build 306 proved this: `run + sample`
  #   PASSED, `HTTP/2 multiplex` FAILED, and a fully valid schema_version:3
  #   result (validity.valid:true, peak_achieved_rps 2000.1) was DISCARDED —
  #   `persist + compare` and `publish` both ended in state waiting_failed.
  #
  #   So `persist + compare` WAITS for all three measurement steps but is
  #   fail-closed on only ONE of them. It depends on `perf-run` with
  #   no `allow_failure` on that edge (the default is false), so a FAILED `perf-run`
  #   SKIPS compare — we never persist or compare a run whose measurement step
  #   failed (the fail-closed guarantee the old `wait` gave, now scoped to the
  #   one step that matters). It also depends on the two notify-only steps with
  #   `allow_failure: true` (the per-dependency property — NOT the step-level
  #   `allow_dependency_failure`, which Buildkite rejects here), so it waits for
  #   them but their red cannot skip it. Their red still surfaces on their own step — deliberate.
  #
  #   Why wait for them at all, rather than dropping the edge? Because compare
  #   MERGES microbench's artifacts, downloading them best-effort (`|| true`).
  #   Depending only on perf-run would let compare start first (the measurement
  #   steps run in parallel on separate perf agents) and persist a day with NO
  #   microbench rows — silently losing the gating metric .microbench.*.time_per_op.
  #   A gate that disappears without going red is a worse failure than the one
  #   this wiring fixes.
  #
  #   `publish` depends on `perf-compare` so a gating regression (which reds
  #   compare) still skips the public-figure PR.
  #
  #   Dependency edges (─▶ = hard / fail-closed; ┄▶ = wait-only, cannot skip):
  #     perf-run        ─▶ perf-compare ─▶ publish
  #     perf-microbench ┄▶ perf-compare
  #     perf-h2multiplex┄▶ perf-compare
  #     perf-allocprofile  (NO edge — standalone by design: a deep, throughput-degraded
  #                         run must never be waited on, gated, or baselined)
  #
  #   DO NOT "tidy" this back into a plain `- wait: ~`: that reintroduces the
  #   exact build-306 bug where a notify-only red throws away a valid baseline.
