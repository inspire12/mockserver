# HTTP/2 multiplex benchmark step (perf queue) — answers the open question from
# issue #2669: what does giving every HTTP/2 stream its own child channel cost
# under concurrency? Two attempts to measure this on the dev laptop failed (memory
# pressure), so it belongs on a quiet CI agent, which is here.
#
# TWO axes, both from issue #2669's HTTP/2-multiplex migration, both emitted into
# perf-h2-multiplex.json and persisted into the S3 run history by perf-test-compare.sh:
#
#   1. THROUGHPUT / LATENCY (org.mockserver.benchmark.Http2StreamChannelBenchmark):
#      N concurrent streams over ONE h2c connection, sweeping N = 1, 10, 100 (the
#      server caps MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS at 100, so 100 is the single-connection
#      ceiling). Emits {h2_multiplex:{streams_<N>:{throughput_rps, p50_us, ...}}}.
#
#   2. PER-CONNECTION MEMORY (org.mockserver.benchmark.Http2ConnectionMemoryBenchmark,
#      programme item 11): a CONNECTIONS axis — N connections x M concurrent in-flight
#      streams, shapes 1x1, 10x10, 100x10 — recording the heap delta per established
#      connection, exactly what the 8.0.0 changelog warned the multiplex migration
#      changed. The event log is cleared before each heap sample so the delta measures
#      connection + stream child-channel state, not logged bodies. Emits
#      {h2_connection_memory:{conn_<C>x<S>:{bytes_per_connection, ...}}}. The two JSON
#      objects are jq-merged into the single perf-h2-multiplex.json artifact below.
#
# NOTIFY-ONLY, and there is deliberately NO build-FAILING threshold on either axis:
# run-to-run variance on real build agents is unknown, so a gating threshold now would
# be guessing. They are recorded so a gating threshold can be added later once variance
# is known. The bytes_per_connection budget key (h2_connection_memory.*.bytes_per_connection
# in perf-budgets.json) is committed NON-GATING but is now SURFACED per run: the daily
# compare's metrics jq reads .h2_connection_memory and annotates each shape's
# bytes_per_connection notify-only against that budget, so a move is visible every build
# but cannot red the pipeline (see the item-11 clause in perf-test-compare.sh).
#
# The dated per-connection numbers here are a TREND signal for the current build. The
# one-time pre-8.0.0-vs-8.0.0 comparison that actually answers the changelog is the
# optional cross-version arm at the end of this script (H2_MEM_COMPARE_IMAGES), which
# drives an identical external client against two server images and diffs container RSS.
#
# The harness self-validates and exits NON-ZERO (code 2) on any integrity breach
# (incomplete run, non-200/body mismatch, sub-µs latency, impossible throughput).
# That failure is HARNESS-VALIDATION and is intentionally distinct from "perf got
# slower" (which never fails — there is no threshold). A non-zero exit here means
# the measurement is untrustworthy and MUST surface as a red build, so this step
# has no soft_fail. Before the sweep we run the harness `selftest` (server-free)
# to prove every gate still fires.
#
# Heavy (builds mockserver-netty + boots a real server), so it runs only in the
# scheduled/manual perf pipeline on the dedicated box.

# --- OPTIONAL one-time cross-version comparison (the changelog's whole point) ------------------------------

# which are present on a dev laptop but not on a clean CI agent. Set H2_MEM_COMPARE_IMAGES to two
# space/comma-separated image tags to run it. It drives the SAME external client (the benchmark's `hold`
# mode) against each image, holding the client side constant, and diffs the server container's RSS per
# established connection — so the difference is attributable to the server-side change. Skipped by default;
# never fails the step (it is an investigation, not a gate).
