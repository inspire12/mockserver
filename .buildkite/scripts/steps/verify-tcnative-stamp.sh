# Fail closed when a Docker-consumed server jar is missing the netty-tcnative
# version stamp the Dockerfiles derive their native .so download from.
#
# WHY
# ---
# netty-tcnative is a JNI library: pure-Java "classes" (shaded into the server
# uber-jar) plus a per-platform native .so that MUST be the EXACT same version or
# TLS fails at runtime. The uber-jar ships no natives, so the Docker images fetch
# the matching .so at build time, deriving the version from a stamp baked into the
# jar itself — `META-INF/mockserver-tcnative.version` (see
# mockserver-netty-no-dependencies/src/packaging/stamp-tcnative-version.sh).
#
# TWO jars carry that stamp, each feeding a different Docker `source` mode:
#   * the maven-shade  mockserver-netty-no-dependencies jar         (its stamp reaches the
#                      source=copy images unchanged, via the mockserver-netty-docker jar)
#   * the maven-assembly mockserver-netty-<ver>-jar-with-dependencies.jar
#                                                                   (source=download, the default)
# The stamp was once added to only ONE of the two — silently breaking the default
# download image for every release. Nothing built either image on that change, so
# only human review caught it. This guard is the automated backstop: it proves,
# over the REAL built artifacts, that BOTH stamps exist, are well-formed, agree
# with each other, and agree with the Maven-resolved tcnative version.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS (fails closed — exit 1 — on any):
#   * each stamped jar is present exactly once (a missing build output is a
#     failure, never a silent skip);
#   * each jar actually contains META-INF/mockserver-tcnative.version;
#   * each stamp is non-empty and matches a tcnative version (e.g. 2.0.81.Final);
#   * the two stamps are identical to each other;
#   * both equal the version Maven resolves for
#     io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static (the netty-bom governed truth the
#     stamp itself is derived from).
#
# HOW IT OBTAINS THE JARS
#   It does NOT build them. It consumes the two stamped jars that a normal reactor
#   `clean install` produces under mockserver/mockserver-netty*/target (the
#   assembly jar-with-dependencies is built by assembly:single at the `package`
#   phase; skipAssembly defaults to false), so it runs in seconds and cannot be
#   starved by agent capacity. If a jar is absent the guard FAILS — that means the
#   build did not produce it, which is exactly the condition worth failing on.
#
# WHERE IT ACTUALLY RUNS (keep this accurate)
#   * The developer pre-commit gate — .opencode/rules/commit-workflow.md runs it as
#     the fast inner tcnative-stamp check before a commit.
#   * As the inner gate of docker-build-verify.sh (which runs it, then builds the
#     image and proves the native .so loads at runtime).
#   It is NOT currently wired into any Buildkite pipeline: it is absent from
#   pipeline-java.yml, and the docker-build-verify.sh CI step was removed from
#   pipeline-container-tests.yml (see the note there). Re-landing CI stamp coverage
#   is tracked in that pipeline file. If you wire it into pipeline-java.yml, it must
#   run AFTER the install that produces the jars (in-job, after `:maven: build`, so
#   the jars and a warm ~/.m2 are on the same agent — a separate Buildkite step does
#   NOT share the build agent's filesystem) — update this note when you do.
#
# SELF-TEST
#   Point STAMP_ASSEMBLY_JAR (or STAMP_SHADED_JAR) at a jar with no stamp — or an
#   empty/garbage file — and the guard goes red, exactly like the certificate
#   guard's CERT_EXPIRY_HARD_FAIL_DAYS override. STAMP_EXPECTED_VERSION overrides
#   the Maven resolution (self-test / environments without the reactor).
#
# Requires: unzip, grep, sed, sort, and (unless STAMP_EXPECTED_VERSION is set) the
# Maven wrapper under mockserver/. Runs directly on the agent (no Docker).
