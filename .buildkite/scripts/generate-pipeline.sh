STEPS=""

# --- Native trigger vs command-step trigger (hybrid) -------------------------
# A native Buildkite `trigger` step runs inside the Buildkite backend and
# occupies NO agent. The alternative — a `command` step that runs
# trigger-pipeline.sh — holds an agent for the child build's entire duration
# (it polls in a loop), which saturates the small agent cap when several
# dispatcher builds run at once. So we prefer the native step.
#
# BUT the native step is only safe for NON-PR (push) builds. A native trigger
# step creates the child build as the *parent build's author*, inheriting that
# author's Buildkite permissions. Bot-authored PRs (e.g. Dependabot) have no
# Buildkite permissions, so a native trigger step fails SILENTLY for them —
# the child build is simply never created and nothing turns red. The
# command/script path avoids this because trigger-pipeline.sh authenticates
# with the pipeline's own API token and passes the PR metadata explicitly.
# This exact hybrid was adopted and reverted twice for this reason
# (23c51bab8, 553784bf3); DO NOT "simplify" it into an unconditional native
# trigger or you will silently break every bot PR again.
#
# The hazard above is about the build's AUTHOR, but this gate used to test only
# whether the build was a PR — and a merged Dependabot PR is neither. It lands on
# master as a PUSH build (BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST="false") still authored by
# dependabot[bot], so it took the native path and walked straight into the trap
# the comment describes. Observed on orchestrator builds 7357, 7358, 7359 and
# 7361: every one authored by dependabot[bot] with `creator: None`, and on each
# of them the SAME six trigger steps (Java, Go, .NET, Rust, PHP, Infra) failed in
# under half a second with `triggered_build: null` and no child build created,
# while the human-authored build 7356 created all thirteen. Those commits were
# reported red having never run a test.
#
# So gate on the thing that actually matters — is there an authenticated
# Buildkite user behind this build whose permissions the child build can inherit?
# BUILDKITE_BUILD_CREATOR is empty exactly when the REST API reports
# `creator: None`, which is the condition under which a native trigger is
# refused. The author check is a belt-and-braces second signal for a bot identity
# that somehow does carry a creator.
#
# BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST is the literal string "false" on push builds and the
# PR number otherwise. We take the native path ONLY on an explicit "false"; a
# PR number OR an unset/empty value both fall through to the safe command
# path (the conservative direction — worst case is an agent held, never a
# silently-skipped build). The same conservative direction applies to both new
# conditions: when in doubt, use the command path, which authenticates with the
# pipeline's own API token and therefore cannot be refused for want of a user.

    # UPLOAD, not silently no-op. Dropping `retry` is also correct on its own —
    # that block only guards the agent running the polling script against Spot
    # reclamation, and a native trigger has no agent to reclaim.
    #
    # `async: false` (the default, set explicitly for clarity) makes a failed
    # child fail this parent, and makes cancelling the parent cancel the child.

    # trigger-pipeline.sh sends (the parent build's values). The native-step
    # defaults are NOT these — they are HEAD, the child pipeline's default
    # branch, and the trigger step's label respectively. The non-PR path sends
    # no env (trigger-pipeline.sh's ENV_VARS is {} for non-PR builds), so
    # build.env is omitted. `ignore_pipeline_branch_filters` has no native-step
    # equivalent and is unnecessary here: a push build's branch is master, which

# Runs on EVERY build, deliberately outside the path-filtered triggers above. The client version

# mockserver-client-python/mockserver/launcher.py, ...), so a commit that drifts one of them routes
# only to that client's own pipeline. Attaching this to any path filter means the guard never sees
# the change it exists to catch. It is a few greps and costs ~1s.
#
# The false-green guard runs always-on for the same reason: a new false-green shape can be introduced
# from a Java test source (routes to mockserver-java), a .buildkite step script (mockserver-infra), a
# client test step (that client's pipeline) or a container_integration_tests script — no single
# path-filtered pipeline sees them all, so only an always-on step catches every case. Also greps-only,
# ~1s.
#
# The shared-RNG hot-path guard is always-on for the same reason: a new Math.random(), unseeded
# new Random(), UUID.randomUUID() or new SecureRandom() can be introduced from any server-runtime Java
# source (mockserver-core / -netty / -async), and each draws from a shared, contended static generator
# that serialises the worker event loops under load. Three earlier sweeps each fixed one such shape by
# enumerating it once; only an always-on control stops the next one reappearing. Greps-only, ~1s.
