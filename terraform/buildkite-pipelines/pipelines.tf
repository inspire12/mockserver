# detector that shares the producer's schedule dies with it. Fires at 16:00 UTC,
# well clear of the producer (04:00) and the cleanup sweep (06:00), so a dead
# producer schedule is detected within ~a day. The freshness step keys off the

# Weekly performance SOAK run (item 10 of the performance programme). soak.js runs
# for 2h on the `perf` queue under sustained load, surfacing slow degradation a
# short regression run cannot (data-plane p99 drift as the event log fills, leaks
# over hours) and measuring the cost of verify / retrieveRecordedRequests against a
# FULL log (item 10b).
#
# WHY SUNDAY 08:00 UTC — NOT the daily regression's slot. The `perf` queue has
# perf_max_size agents (terraform/buildkite-agents), one per machine. A daily
# regression build fans its four measurement steps out across those agents and can
# hold all of them at once, so a soak started in the 04:00 window would queue
# behind it. 08:00 is clear of the daily's worst case (every step at its timeout,
# per perf-test-guard.sh), of the 06:00 cleanup and of the 16:00 baseline-freshness
# check (which runs in the infra pipeline on a different queue anyway). Sunday is
# the lowest-commit day, so the commit-gated daily regression most often skips and
# an ad-hoc [perf-run]/[perf-inject] is least likely to contend for the perf
# agents. The [perf-soak] marker routes this build to the soak step ONLY
# (pipeline-perf-test.yml gates the daily guard and load test OFF for a [perf-soak]
# build), so the soak never triggers the daily regression dispatch. No queue-
# capacity change is needed: this only enqueues a build; the perf ASG scales from
# and back to min_size = 0 on demand (which MUST stay 0).

  # Audit finding F-BK-CLOUD-02: pipelines that load secrets via AWS Secrets

  #
  # Pipelines that don't load secrets — or where the token is fully
  # protected by `set +x` guards and never appears in stdout/stderr —
  # can remain PUBLIC. Public visibility is necessary for OSS contributor
  # UX: external PR submitters need to see their own build logs to debug
  # failures; flipping these PRIVATE blocks them at a Buildkite login
  # page and forces maintainers to relay log excerpts manually.
  #
  # Note on "pipeline" (the top-level mockserver dispatcher):
  # generate-pipeline.sh fetches a Buildkite API token to query the last
  # successful build for path-based change detection. Mitigation is in
  # depth: `{ set +x; } 2>/dev/null` (F-BK-04) suppresses xtrace before
  # the secret fetch; the token is only sent in a curl `-H Authorization`
  # header (never via stdout-visible flags); Buildkite's secret redaction
  # covers known token patterns. Accepted residual risk: the only
  # plausible leak vector is an AWS CLI error mode that includes secret
  # material in the error message — which AWS CLI does not do in practice.
  # If a future refactor of generate-pipeline.sh removes the API-token
  # dependency entirely (e.g. by caching last-successful-SHA as a build
  # artifact), this caveat goes away.

  # Cancel superseded in-progress builds on feature/PR branches (saves agent VMs
  # during rapid iteration), but NEVER on master: a master build that is canceled
  # mid-run reports as a misleading failure on the triggering pipeline, and the
  # commit goes untested. Long pipelines (container-tests ~20m, performance-test)
  # were the worst hit because, without this filter, every fresh master commit
  # canceled the previous still-running build before it could report. master builds
  # now always run to completion and report true pass/fail.
  #
  # SKIPPING of queued (not-yet-started) builds carries the SAME filter, and the
  # reasoning that once left it unfiltered was wrong for one pipeline. That
  # reasoning was: a skipped build reports "skipped" (neutral), not red, so
  # dropping an obsolete queued build is free. True when a build is a COMMIT
  # VALIDATION — a newer commit supersedes it and nothing is lost.
  #
  # It is false when the build IS THE MEASUREMENT. The daily performance run is
  # created at 04:00 and then QUEUES, because the perf queue is scale-to-zero with a
  # small agent cap. Any push to master during that wait created a newer build and the
  # queued daily was skipped before it ever started — so no measurement happened
  # that day, and perf-baseline-freshness.sh correctly reddened every subsequent
  # master build for reporting a producer that had not run.
  #
  # Proven on demand (2026-09-19) rather than inferred: on a throwaway branch,
  # build #1937 was left queued and #1938 created seconds later; #1937 flipped to
  # "skipped" immediately and never started. Observed for real on the daily —
  # #312 (schedule, master) was skipped 272s after creation, while #272, which had
  # a ~90 minute gap before the next build, ran.
  #
  # Filtering skip on !master therefore protects every scheduled/master build from
  # being dropped before it runs, while keeping the cost saving where it is safe:
  # feature and PR branches still skip their queued builds, which is what stops a
  # rapid-iteration branch hogging the perf agents.
  #
  # NARROWED TO THE PERF PIPELINE (2026-09-19, after G7). The first cut of this
  # applied the !master skip filter to every pipeline. A review judged that safe
  # because the other queues autoscale — but it did not consider the `trigger`
  # queue, which is HARD-CAPPED at 16 agents (4 instances x 4) and is the real
  # binding constraint. Each master commit spawns a dispatcher build that emits
  # one BLOCKING trigger step per affected child pipeline (trigger-pipeline.sh
  # polls in a sleep loop), and each of those holds a trigger agent for the whole
  # child build. Six concurrent dispatcher builds x 19 child pipelines is ~100
  # blocking waits against 16 slots; observed saturating for ~an hour and starving
  # the perf guard step, which also runs on `trigger`.
  #
  # Keeping master builds alive on EVERY pipeline would multiply exactly those
  # blocking waits during exactly the commit bursts that cause the saturation. So
  # the exemption is scoped to the pipeline that actually needs it: the perf
  # pipeline, whose scheduled daily IS the measurement and cannot be superseded.
  # Everywhere else, skipping a queued master build stays on — and now also serves
  # as the relief valve for trigger-queue pressure.
