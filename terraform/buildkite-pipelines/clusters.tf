# Buildkite cluster migration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Buildkite is deprecating unclustered (organization-level) agents, so the org's
# UI no longer exposes org-level agent tokens. All MockServer pipelines and
# agents are migrated onto the pre-existing "Default cluster":
#
#   - every pipeline is assigned to the cluster (cluster_id in pipelines.tf)
#   - the agent queues are created as cluster queues
#   - a single cluster agent token is minted and published to SSM, where the
#     buildkite-agents stack's run.sh reads it (TF_VAR_buildkite_agent_token).
#     This also removes the inline token from buildkite-agents/terraform.tfvars
#     (audit finding: agent token must not live on local disk).
#
# Apply ORDER: this stack first (creates queues + token + SSM param + assigns
# pipelines), then terraform/buildkite-agents (picks up the new token from SSM
# and rolls the launch templates). Agents are scale-to-zero, so the cutover has
# no in-flight builds to disrupt.

# Agent queues. These KEYS must match `buildkite_queue` in
# terraform/buildkite-agents/main.tf (the elastic-ci-stack modules tag their
# agents with these queue keys). The cluster's auto-created "default-queue" is
