  # `vite build` spawned by mockserver-netty's frontend-maven-plugin — whose
  # ~1.5-3g peak is rolldown NATIVE memory that no Node heap flag can bound. On
  # 16 GiB those two could not both fit under the 7g container limit and OOM-killed

  # order, so a type slow enough to be unwanted must be removed, not demoted.

  # upstream=6, k6=8-13, i.e. 13 cores, and the previous c5.4xlarge has 16 vCPU but
  # only EIGHT physical cores. k6 therefore ran on the hyperthread siblings of cores
  # the server was already saturating, so every throughput figure measured a server
  # contending with its own load generator — and it is the main reason "the client
  # saturates first" blocked the 36k knee (k6 read 600.9% against a 600% pin on a
  # run that otherwise passed).
  #
  # 24 physical cores fits the 13 with room to widen k6 for the higher sweep rungs.
  # Single-socket, so the server stays in one NUMA domain, and the same c5 (Cascade
  # Lake) microarchitecture as before, which keeps cross-hardware drift to a minimum.
  # c5.18xlarge and above are dual-socket — do not go there without re-checking NUMA.

  # CHANGING THIS VALUE REQUIRES RE-REVIEWING THE `hw` FLAGS in
  # mockserver-performance-test/perf-budgets.json. Metrics marked `hw` compare only
  # against runs from the same instance type, so they reset their baseline here and
  # sit at `no-baseline` until MIN_BASELINE runs exist on the new box. A metric that
  # SHOULD be marked and is not will instead compare straight across the change —
  # silently, because an absent `hw` is legal and means hardware-independent. The
  # validator cannot catch that omission, and no low-false-positive mechanical rule
  # can either: hw-mixed metric families are the norm, not the exception (behaviours
  # p95 is hw but error_rate is not; laptop threads are but tcp_sockets are not), so
  # both sibling-consistency and name-suffix rules would fire constantly on correct
  # entries. This note is the control instead — a review triggered at the one moment
  # it matters, with no false positives the rest of the time.
