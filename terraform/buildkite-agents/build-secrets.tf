# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Secrets Manager secrets and per-secret IAM policies
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each secret has its own narrowly-scoped IAM policy so queues receive only
# the credentials they actually consume.  Attachment to queues is in main.tf.
#
# Queue -> secret mapping (verified by grepping .buildkite/scripts):
#   default:  buildkite-api-token-readonly (generate-pipeline.sh change detection),
#             buildkite-api-token (cleanup-closed-pr-builds.sh, via read_build_secrets_default),
#             dockerhub (docker-login.sh for snapshot push),
#             sonatype (java-deploy-snapshot.sh, master-only)
#   trigger:  buildkite-api-token (trigger-pipeline.sh orchestration, write),
#             buildkite-api-token-readonly (perf-test-guard.sh change detection)
#   perf:     buildkite-api-token-readonly (perf-test-guard.sh commit comparison)
#             (perf also attaches the write buildkite-api-token, which looks unused; to review)
#   perf-xl:  buildkite-api-token-readonly only
#   release:  buildkite-api-token, dockerhub, sonatype, pypi, rubygems,
#             plus release-only secrets in read_release_secrets
#
# The Buildkite API token is split three ways: a READ-ONLY token for change
# detection, a WRITE token (buildkite-api-token) for trigger/cleanup build
# control, and a separate management token (buildkite-tf-token) used only by the
# Terraform provider (never granted to a queue).

# (cancel/delete). Change-detection (last-successful-commit.sh) uses the separate

#
# NOTE: Docker Hub personal access tokens cannot be scoped to a single repo/tag
# on the current plan, so both tokens technically have the same Docker Hub push
# rights. The benefit of the split is therefore credential separation: independent
# rotation/revocation, separate audit trail, and the AWS-level guarantee above
