# The versioned-site release step runs terraform against the terraform/website
# stack, whose state lives in this account's mockserver-terraform-state bucket
# under website/terraform.tfstate. Grant the release-queue agent access to that
# state object (and its S3-native lock) so `terraform init`/`plan`/`apply` can
# read and write it. Scoped to the website/ prefix so the agent cannot read
# other stacks' state (e.g. buildkite-agents/terraform.tfstate).
#
# The S3-native locking backend (use_lockfile = true) writes a .tflock file
# next to the state file. DeleteObject is needed ONLY on the lock file (to
# release the lock after apply), not on the state file itself.
