# Java Examples

Java client and proxy examples for MockServer. Unlike the other tracks, this is a
**buildable Maven project** (`org.mock-server:mockserver-examples`). It is sample code —
**not** a published artifact (see the `### Removed` note in the repo `changelog.md`) — and
it is **not** a module of the `mockserver` reactor, which is precisely what keeps it
unpublished, since the release deploys that reactor. It is instead
built and tested standalone: its parent POM is `../../mockserver/pom.xml`, so it resolves the
reactor's just-installed `SNAPSHOT` artifacts from your local `~/.m2`. CI keeps it compiled
**and** tested by running a second, standalone Maven invocation immediately after the reactor
`install` (`scripts/buildkite_quick_build.sh`), so the examples still cannot silently rot.

## What it demonstrates

- **Mocking scenarios** — [`src/main/java/org/mockserver/examples/mockserver/`](src/main/java/org/mockserver/examples/mockserver/): response actions, forward actions, callbacks, OpenAPI expectations, request matchers, verification, recording/retrieval, interactive breakpoints (modify proxied exchanges).
- **Stateful scenarios** — [`src/test/java/org/mockserver/examples/mockserver/StatefulScenarioExamples.java`](src/test/java/org/mockserver/examples/mockserver/StatefulScenarioExamples.java): a single runnable, self-asserting test demonstrating all 5 canonical stateful-scenario features via the typed Java client — a login state machine (`withScenarioName`/`withScenarioState`/`withNewScenarioState`), sequential multi-response cycling (`withHttpResponses` + `ResponseMode.SEQUENTIAL`), a timed auto-transition (`scenario(name).set(state, ms, next)`), an external trigger (`scenario(name).trigger(state)`), and a cross-protocol trigger (`withCrossProtocolScenario(...)`). It starts its own embedded MockServer by default, or connects to one given by `MOCKSERVER_HOST`/`MOCKSERVER_PORT`, and resets the server before each scenario.
- **Load scenarios** — [`src/test/java/org/mockserver/examples/mockserver/LoadScenarioExamples.java`](src/test/java/org/mockserver/examples/mockserver/LoadScenarioExamples.java): a single runnable, self-asserting test exercising the **Load Scenario registry** via the typed Java client — register (`loadScenario`), start (`startLoadScenarios`), list (`loadScenarios`, asserting `RUNNING`), live status (`getLoadScenario`), stop (`stopLoadScenarios`) and clear (`clearLoadScenarios`) — driving a realistic multi-stage scenario (RATE ramp → VU hold → PAUSE with two Velocity-templated steps and a `withStartDelayMillis`). It starts its own embedded MockServer **with load generation enabled** (`configuration().loadGenerationEnabled(true)`), or connects to one given by `MOCKSERVER_HOST`/`MOCKSERVER_PORT` (which must itself set `-Dmockserver.loadGenerationEnabled=true`).
- **Proxying with a range of HTTP libraries** — [`src/main/java/org/mockserver/examples/proxy/`](src/main/java/org/mockserver/examples/proxy/): Apache HttpClient, Google HTTP Client, JDK `HttpURLConnection`, Jersey, Jetty, Spring `RestTemplate`, and Spring `WebClient`.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17+ and Maven.
- The MockServer `SNAPSHOT` artifacts this project depends on must be in your local `~/.m2`.
  Because `examples/java` is **not** a reactor module you cannot reach it with `-pl`/`-am`
  from the reactor (Maven reports `Could not find the selected project in the reactor`).
  Install the reactor first:

  ```bash
  # From the repo root — installs the reactor's SNAPSHOT artifacts into ~/.m2:
  ( cd mockserver && ./mvnw -pl mockserver-netty-no-dependencies,mockserver-client-java-no-dependencies,mockserver-testing -am install -DskipTests )
  ```

## Run

Build/test the examples **standalone** (this is exactly what CI does after the reactor
`install`):

```bash
# From the repo root — compile/package (uses the mvnw wrapper in mockserver/):
mockserver/mvnw -f examples/java/pom.xml package -DskipTests

# Run the example tests (they start a MockServer and exercise the scenarios):
mockserver/mvnw -f examples/java/pom.xml test
```

## Expected output

`BUILD SUCCESS`, with the example tests starting an embedded MockServer, registering
expectations, exercising each client/scenario, and verifying the recorded interactions.
