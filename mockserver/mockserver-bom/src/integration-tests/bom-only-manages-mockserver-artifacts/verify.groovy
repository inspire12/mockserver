// completion (every assertion above passed). The maven-enforcer requireFilesExist execution in
// pom.xml asserts this marker exists after the invoker run; if the invoker plugin ever SILENTLY
// SKIPS this hook (no Groovy interpreter on its classpath, or a hook-filename mismatch), the marker
// is absent and the build fails LOUDLY instead of passing vacuously. The marker lives under the
// invoker project's target/, which the invoker goal's own `clean` wipes at the start of every run,
// so a stale marker from an earlier run cannot satisfy the check.
