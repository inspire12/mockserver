/**
 * Deterministic proof that {@link MockServerClient#hasStopped()} distinguishes a MockServer that has
 * genuinely stopped from one that is still bound but too slow to answer.
 *
 * <p><strong>The defect this pins down.</strong> {@code hasStopped()} used to probe with
 * {@code ignoreErrors=true}, which collapses <em>both</em> a connection refusal and a read timeout
 * into a {@code null} response, and then treated that {@code null} as "stopped". That is a fail-open:
 * a MockServer that was alive and still holding its port - merely paused by GC or starved of CPU -
 * reported itself stopped. Callers then rebound the port and got a {@code BindException} raised far
 * away from the real cause, which is what made the failure look like a port race.
 *
 * <p>These tests exercise the two cases against real sockets, so they are deterministic rather than
 * timing-dependent: an unresponsive-but-bound server always times out, and a closed port always
 * refuses. {@code shouldNotReportStoppedWhenStillBoundButUnresponsive} fails against the old
 * fail-open implementation and passes against the fixed one.
