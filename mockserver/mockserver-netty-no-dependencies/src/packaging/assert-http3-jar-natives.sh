# Fail the build if the HTTP/3 classifier jar does not carry the QUIC natives.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# This is the other half of assert-slim-jar-natives.sh. Since the QUIC natives were
# split into their own classifier, the default and slim assemblies EXCLUDE
# "META-INF/native/*quiche*" and only -jar-with-dependencies-http3 carries them.
# That makes the http3 jar the single artifact where HTTP/3 can actually work, and
# leaves its native payload unguarded: if the exclude were ever copied into the
# http3 descriptor, or the netty QUIC artifact were renamed or dropped from the
# dependency tree, the assembly would still build and publish. MockServer would
# start, accept the http3Port configuration, and then fail to load the QUIC
# provider at runtime - the exact silent-degradation class of bug the sibling
# guard exists to prevent, just on the other side of the split.
#
# Maven's assembly plugin does not fail when an <include> matches nothing, so
# nothing upstream of this script would notice.
#
# The expected set is every platform netty publishes a quiche binary for. It is
# spelled out rather than counted so that a DROPPED platform is named in the
# failure, not just totalled.
