/**
 * Test-harness UDP port allocation, the counterpart of {@link org.mockserver.socket.PortFactory}
 * (which covers TCP).
 *
 * <p><strong>The find-then-bind window.</strong> Finding a free port means binding port 0, recording
 * what the OS assigned, then closing the socket so the code under test can bind it. Between the close
 * and the real bind another process can take the port. Binding the real socket directly is the only
 * fully race-free option, so callers that can retry on {@code BindException} should.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why candidates come from an IPv4 socket.</strong> A server bound to the dual-stack wildcard
 * (as MockServer's HTTP/3 server is) can, on macOS, bind a port that another process holds with an IPv4
 * UDP socket, without a {@code BindException}; datagrams sent to {@code 127.0.0.1:port} then reach that
 * other socket instead. The dual-stack allocator behind a plain {@code new DatagramSocket(0)} can hand
 * out such a port, but the IPv4 allocator cannot, so candidates are taken from it (as
 * {@code PortFactory} does for TCP). Test clients have the same problem; see {@link Ipv4DatagramChannelFactory}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why these probes deliberately do not set {@code SO_REUSEADDR}.</strong> {@code PortFactory}
 * sets it on its TCP probes so a caller can re-bind a just-released port without waiting for
 * {@code TIME_WAIT}. That reasoning does <em>not</em> carry over to UDP. On BSD-derived systems (macOS)
 * two UDP sockets that both set {@code SO_REUSEADDR} can bind the same port <em>simultaneously and
 * silently</em>, with no {@code BindException} - datagrams then reach only one of them. Setting it here
 * would let two concurrent probes "find" the same port and both believe they owned it, manufacturing
 * the collision this class exists to avoid. Keep it off.
