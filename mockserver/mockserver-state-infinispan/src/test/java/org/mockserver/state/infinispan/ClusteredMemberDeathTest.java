/**
 * Performance-programme item 13 negative control: <b>kill a cluster member
 * mid-run and record the survivor's behaviour</b>.
 * <p>
 * This is the in-JVM counterpart to the perf harness's clustered A/B (item 13 in
 * {@code perf-test-run.sh}). That harness measures the per-request cost of
 * membership and forms/breaks a cluster to prove its genuineness gate can red
 * ({@code PERF_CLU_BREAK=cluster} starts node B in a different cluster so the view
 * never reaches 2). Neither that harness nor the existing suite ever kills a
 * <em>formed</em> member <em>mid-run</em> and asserts what the survivor does — the
 * behaviour the mandate's central-deployment profile depends on. This test does.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the observation is ownership-independent (the {@code 9642abe8e} trap).</b>
 * Every MockServer clustered cache is {@code REPL_SYNC}
 * ({@link InfinispanStateBackend}), so <em>every node holds a full replica of
 * every key</em>. A survivor therefore reads seeded state out of its own local
 * copy no matter which node was the key's JGroups primary owner — there is no coin
 * flip. This is exactly the property that node-local {@code Cache.evict()} does NOT
 * have (see {@code ClusteredTwoNodeTest.nodeLocalCounterEvictionIsNotReplicatedToPeer}):
 * eviction removes one node's copy, replication puts a copy on all of them. The
 * bounded-{@code Times} counter that {@code 9642abe8e} moved to a dedicated
 * replicated cache is asserted here to survive a peer death at its true decremented
 * value — NOT resurrected to its full allotment — for the same reason.
 * <p>
 * <b>What "red" means for this control.</b> The load-bearing assertion is that the
 * survivor still serves the seeded state after its peer is stopped. Its recorded
 * negative control (degrade-and-confirm-red) is that if the survivor's replica is
 * removed before the peer dies — the fleet then holds the value nowhere — the same
 * assertion goes red. That degrade is documented on
 * {@link #survivorKeepsReplicatedStateAfterPeerIsKilledMidRun()} and is exercised by
 * evicting the survivor's replicas immediately before the kill; see the programme
 * plan's item-13 acceptance row for the recorded run.
 * <p>
 * No Docker, no external service: the cluster forms in-JVM over the built-in
 * JGroups loopback stack, exactly as {@link ClusteredTwoNodeTest} does.
