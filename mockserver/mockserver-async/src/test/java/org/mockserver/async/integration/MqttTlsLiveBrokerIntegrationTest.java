/**
 * Credential-enforcement integration tests for MQTT security, driven against a real
 * Mosquitto broker configured with a {@code password_file} and {@code allow_anonymous false}.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link MqttLiveBrokerIntegrationTest} (which runs an {@code allow_anonymous true}
 * plaintext broker and therefore never exercises authentication), this suite proves that
 * {@link MqttSecurity} credentials are actually <em>applied and enforced</em> on the wire:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a publisher wired with the <em>correct</em> username/password authenticates,
 *       connects and delivers a message to an authenticated subscriber; and</li>
 *   <li>a publisher wired with the <em>wrong</em> password (and one with no credentials at
 *       all) is <em>rejected</em> by the broker at CONNECT.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The correct-credentials delivery test is the positive control for the wiring: if
 * {@code MqttSecurityOptions} stopped applying the credentials, the correct-credentials
 * client would be rejected by the {@code allow_anonymous false} broker and that test would
 * turn RED — proving the assertion genuinely depends on credential enforcement rather than
 * passing vacuously.
 * <p>
 * Docker-gated: SKIPS (not fails) when Docker is unavailable.
