/**
 * {@code stop()} must not return while a publish cycle is still in flight.
 *
 * <p>Callers close the publishers immediately after {@code stop()} returns — the control plane's
 * teardown does exactly that — so a scheduler thread still inside {@code publishAll} would be publishing
 * against a channel being closed underneath it. {@code shutdownNow()} alone does not prevent this:
 * it interrupts the worker and returns straight away, without waiting for it to unwind.
 *
 * <p>The blocking publisher below is what makes this discriminating. A publisher that returns
 * immediately would pass whether or not {@code stop()} waits, because the race window would be too
 * small to observe — the same "fixture chosen around the bug" trap that has recurred in this
 * programme. Here the publish takes a known, deliberately long time, so "did stop() wait?" is
 * directly observable rather than inferred from timing luck.
 *
 * <p><strong>The assertion counts starts against completions rather than asking "did some publish
 * finish?"</strong> The weaker form passes vacuously under load: the schedule runs publishes
 * back-to-back, so if enough wall-clock elapses between the latch being released and {@code stop()}
 * being called — a GC pause, or Surefire contention on a machine this repo has run at load 60+ —
 * publish #1 completes and sets a one-way flag, publish #2 is the one actually in flight,
 * {@code shutdownNow()} cuts #2 short, and a "some publish completed" assertion still passes. That
 * is a false green in the very test guarding the race, on exactly the machine profile that
 * provokes it. Comparing counts closes it: a publish cut short never increments the completion
 * counter, so {@code completed == started} is false whenever ANY cycle was interrupted, regardless
 * of how many cycles ran.
