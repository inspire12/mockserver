# Programme item 21 — the CONNECTION-SCALING CEILING: how many concurrent established connections a
# MockServer holds before request latency degrades. Starts a server, runs the ladder against it, stops it.
#
#   ./run-connection-ceiling.sh                 # measure, using the calibrated client ceiling below
#   ./run-connection-ceiling.sh calibrate       # find THIS box's client ceiling and what limits it
#
# -XX:-MaxFDLimit is applied ON macOS ONLY, and that asymmetry is deliberate because the flag does
# OPPOSITE things on the two platforms (both measured):
#   * macOS — the JDK sets its own RLIMIT_NOFILE to min(hard, OPEN_MAX=10240) however high `ulimit -n`
#     reads, so an un-flagged JVM (driver OR server) stops at ~9,977 connections and the "ceiling" you
#     measure is the JDK's. The flag leaves the inherited soft limit alone, so it must be paired with a
#     raised `ulimit -n`: the flag alone gives you whatever the shell had.
#   * Linux — the JDK already raises the soft limit to the HARD limit (1024 -> 1048576 measured). The
#     flag DISABLES that and leaves 1024, making the ceiling ~40x worse. Never pass it here.
# With the clamp lifted on macOS the wall moves to the ephemeral source-port range, measured on this
# laptop at 15,511 connections; spreading across four server ports reached 15,609 (ratio 1.01), so the
# source-port range is GLOBAL and more server ports do not raise the ceiling. Run `calibrate` on any new
# box rather than inheriting these numbers.
#
# GETTING PAST ~15,500 — MULTIPLE CLIENT SOURCE ADDRESSES (REQUIRES ROOT, MANUAL STEP):
#   The ~15,500 wall is the client's GLOBAL ephemeral source-port range, not the server. More SERVER
#   ports do not move it (ratio 1.01 above). The only lever is more client source ADDRESSES: each local
#   address has its own ephemeral range, so N loopback aliases roughly multiply the ceiling by N. Set
#   CEILING_SOURCE_ADDRESSES to a comma-separated list and the driver round-robins connections across
#   them, reporting how many distinct addresses were actually used and how many connections landed on
#   each (so a missing alias cannot be mistaken for a raised ceiling — the driver refuses to start if any
#   listed address is not bindable).
#
#   Creating a non-primary loopback alias needs root, which this script does NOT do for you. On macOS,
#   BEFORE the run, create the aliases (example for three extra addresses):
#       sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up
#       sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.3 up
#       sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.4 up
#   then run e.g.:
#       CEILING_SOURCE_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3,127.0.0.4 \
#         CEILING_LADDER=8000,20000,40000 ./run-connection-ceiling.sh
#   and AFTER the run, TEAR THE ALIASES DOWN so the machine is not left reconfigured:
#       sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 127.0.0.2
#       sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 127.0.0.3
#       sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 127.0.0.4
#   (List current aliases with `ifconfig lo0`; a reboot also clears them. On Linux the whole 127.0.0.0/8
#   is already local, so no alias is needed — just list the addresses. As of this commit the >15,500
#   figure is UNMEASURED here because these aliases were never created — the alias step is root-only.)
#
# Tunables (env): CEILING_MODE (h1|tls|calibrate), CEILING_LADDER, CEILING_PROBE_REQUESTS,
# CEILING_SETTLE_MS, CEILING_WARMUP_REQUESTS, CEILING_TIMEWAIT_DRAIN_MS, CEILING_CLIENT_CEILING,
# CEILING_SERVER_PORTS, CEILING_SOURCE_ADDRESSES.
#
# The ladder must also fit TWO ADJACENT rungs in the port range: a rung's sockets sit in TIME_WAIT for
# 2*MSL (30 s on macOS) after it closes, so 8,000 followed immediately by 12,000 asks for 20,000 ports
# and fails part-way up. CEILING_TIMEWAIT_DRAIN_MS defaults to 45 s for that reason. If the rig does run
# out, the driver records the rung as `rig_valid:false` with `exhausted_by` rather than reporting a
# latency — a rig limit is a result about the rig, never a server ceiling.
