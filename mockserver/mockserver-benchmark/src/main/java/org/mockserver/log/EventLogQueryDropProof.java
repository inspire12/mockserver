/**
 * G2 mechanism proof (NOT a JMH benchmark) — a standalone verifier that a concurrent event-log
 * QUERY (retrieve/verify) can, by monopolising the single disruptor consumer thread, cause
 * serving-path log writes to be DROPPED, silently losing the {@code RECEIVED_REQUEST} evidence a
 * later {@code verify} needs. It lives in {@code org.mockserver.log} so it can build a real
 * {@link MockServerEventLog} through its public API and read {@link MockServerEventLog#getDroppedLogEventCount()}
 * / {@link MockServerEventLog#getRingBufferOccupancy()}.
 *
 * <p><b>The finding under test (G2).</b> {@code MockServerEventLog} runs its disruptor with a SINGLE
 * handler that both APPENDS serving-path entries and RUNS every query (retrieve/verify/clear are
 * dispatched as {@code RUNNABLE} events onto that same consumer thread). A query is an O(n) scan
 * over up to {@code maxLogEntries} entries, each running a full cloned request-match. While that
 * scan monopolises the consumer, serving-path writes — published via the non-blocking
 * {@code tryPublishEvent}, which DROPS on a full ring rather than blocking — back up; once the ring
 * fills they are dropped with only a WARN-once and a bump of {@code mock_server_dropped_log_events}.
 * A user can therefore lose verification evidence, with no error, purely because a retrieval was in
 * flight.
 *
 * <p><b>Two checks, each with its own counterfactual</b> — a number that would look the same whether
 * or not the mechanism fired proves nothing, so each check pairs the suspected-cause arm with a
 * control that removes only the cause:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Held consumer vs free consumer (deterministic, latch-based).</b> With the consumer frozen
 *       by a blocking {@code RUNNABLE}, a fixed flood of {@code W > ringSize} serving-path writes
 *       drops {@code ~W - ringSize} entries; with the consumer FREE the identical flood drops zero
 *       (it drains as fast as it is published). This isolates the drop path itself from write volume
 *       — the flood count is held constant across the two arms, only the hold is removed. This is the
 *       same drop path {@link MockServerEventLogDroppedEventsTest} pins; it is reproduced here as the
 *       race-free floor the second (real-query) check builds on.</li>
 *   <li><b>Real query vs no query (the G2 claim).</b> The log is filled to a large occupancy N and a
 *       paced writer publishes at a rate a FREE consumer sustains with zero drops (the control arm
 *       proves it does). Re-running that identical paced writer while a REAL {@code retrieveRequests}
 *       scan is in flight drops entries — because the scan freezes the consumer for its whole
 *       duration and the paced writes accumulate past the ring. Same writer, same rate, same
 *       occupancy: the only difference is the query, so a drop in the query arm and none in the
 *       control arm is caused BY the query.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Run standalone (prints {@code PROOF: PASS} / {@code PROOF: FAIL}, exits non-zero on failure):
 * <pre>java -cp "target/classes:$(cat target/classpath.txt)" org.mockserver.log.EventLogQueryDropProof</pre>
