/**
 * Programme item 21 — the <b>connection-scaling ceiling</b>: how many concurrent established
 * connections a MockServer holds before request latency degrades.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this needs its own driver.</b> k6 allocates a virtual user per connection and is not
 * built to park tens of thousands of idle ones, so the plan called for a purpose-built holder. This
 * is it: it opens N real connections, proves they are established <em>on the server</em>, parks them
 * idle, and then measures request latency on a <b>separate</b> connection. The held connections
 * generate no traffic — the axis under test is connection <em>state</em>, not offered load.
 *
 * <p><b>The rig is measured before the server is.</b> This programme's recurring failure is a number
 * that turns out to describe the client or the harness, so the client-side limits are established
 * first and every rung carries its own validity block:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Two different client ceilings, and the first one is invisible.</b> {@code CEILING_MODE=calibrate}
 *       opens connections until the kernel refuses and reports <em>which</em> resource ran out, because
 *       file descriptors and source ports look alike in a stack trace and mean opposite things:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li><b>File descriptors.</b> The JDK does not simply inherit the shell's limit, and what it
 *             does instead is <b>opposite on the two platforms</b> — both measured, so do not carry the
 *             flag across:
 *             <ul>
 *               <li><b>macOS</b>: the JDK sets {@code RLIMIT_NOFILE} to {@code min(hard, OPEN_MAX)} =
 *                   <b>10,240</b> however high {@code ulimit -n} reads (a 60,000 shell still yields
 *                   10,240), so an un-flagged JVM stops at ~9,977 connections. That is the JDK, not the
 *                   server — and it binds the <b>server</b> JVM as hard as the driver, so <b>both</b>
 *                   need {@code -XX:-MaxFDLimit}, <em>paired with</em> a raised {@code ulimit -n}: the
 *                   flag leaves the inherited soft limit alone (2,048 stays 2,048).</li>
 *               <li><b>Linux</b>: the JDK already raises the soft limit to the <b>hard</b> limit
 *                   (1,024 to 1,048,576 measured), so no flag is needed. Passing
 *                   {@code -XX:-MaxFDLimit} there <b>disables</b> that raise and leaves 1,024.</li>
 *             </ul></li>
 *         <li><b>Source ports.</b> With the clamp lifted the wall moves to the ephemeral range
 *             (49152-65535 on macOS), measured here at <b>15,511</b> connections. Spreading across four
 *             destination ports reached 15,609 — a ratio of <b>1.01</b>, so on this kernel source ports
 *             come from <em>one global range</em> and giving the server more ports buys nothing. The
 *             multi-port argument is kept only because it costs nothing and does hold on kernels that
 *             key the range by destination.</li>
 *       </ul>
 *       {@link #ephemeralHeadroom} refuses a rung above the measured ceiling rather than letting it fail
 *       as connect errors that read like a server limit.</li>
 *   <li><b>Establishment is proven twice, client and server.</b> Client side: N distinct local
 *       <em>endpoints</em> — address+port pairs, not ports alone, because with more than one source
 *       address the same ephemeral port number legitimately recurs on a different local address and a
 *       port-only count would false-fail. Server side: the event log recorded N received requests —
 *       every parked connection completed a real request before going idle, so the server accepted,
 *       read, matched and answered on it. A connection that only completed a TCP handshake would pass
 *       the first proof and fail the second.</li>
 *   <li><b>Source addresses are counted from the sockets that were actually bound, not the ones asked
 *       for.</b> The ~15,500 wall this item hit is the macOS global ephemeral source-port range, and
 *       the only way past it is more client source <em>addresses</em> (loopback aliases or more
 *       load-generator hosts), not more server ports — the multi-port ratio measured 1.01. So the
 *       driver can round-robin connections across a configured list of local source addresses
 *       ({@code CEILING_SOURCE_ADDRESSES}), giving each address its own ephemeral range. Because this
 *       programme's recurring defect is an instrument that runs honestly while measuring the wrong
 *       subject, every rung reports how many <b>distinct source addresses were actually used</b> and
 *       how many connections landed on <b>each</b>, tallied from {@link Channel#localAddress()} after
 *       the OS assigned it — and {@link #measureRung} throws if that tally does not match the
 *       round-robin distribution the run configured. A misconfiguration that silently collapsed onto
 *       one address (an alias that was never created) therefore fails loudly rather than being read as
 *       a raised ceiling; missing aliases are also caught up front by
 *       {@link #assertSourceAddressesBindable}, which refuses to start.</li>
 *   <li><b>Client CPU headroom</b> is sampled across the probe window. A saturated driver measures
 *       itself, so a rung whose driver CPU has no headroom is marked {@code rig_valid:false} and its
 *       latency is not a server figure.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Every rung is paired with its own baseline.</b> A rung's latency means nothing in isolation on
 * a laptop, so each rung is preceded by a zero-connection sample and reported as a ratio to <em>that</em>
 * one. A single baseline at the start of the run is not enough: measured that way this box drifted
 * <b>35%</b> faster across one ladder — larger than any effect the ladder was looking for, and
 * monotonic, so every higher rung appeared to be an improvement. Pairing cancels drift slower than a
 * pair; the first-to-last baseline gap is still printed, as a measure of how much the box moved. The
 * discarded warm-up exists for the same reason at a shorter timescale: the first sample of an un-warmed
 * driver reads several times steady state.
 *
 * <p><b>Scope.</b> Plaintext HTTP/1.1 keep-alive ({@code h1}) and the same over TLS ({@code tls}),
 * where the extra axis is the server's per-connection session and {@code SSLEngine} state. HTTP/2 is
 * deliberately <b>not</b> covered here: its connection axis is streams-per-connection, which
 * {@link Http2ConnectionMemoryBenchmark} already measures on the memory axis, and mixing the two
 * would confuse "connections held" with "streams held".
 *
 * <p>Usage: {@code ConnectionCeilingBenchmark <host> <port[,port...]>}, configured by environment:
 * <pre>
 *   CEILING_MODE            h1 (default) | tls
 *   CEILING_LADDER          comma-separated connection counts, e.g. 250,1000,4000,8000
 *   CEILING_PROBE_REQUESTS  sequential requests per latency sample (default 300)
 *   CEILING_SETTLE_MS       pause after parking a rung before probing (default 500)
 *   CEILING_WARMUP_REQUESTS discarded requests run before the first rung (default 2000)
 *   CEILING_SOURCE_ADDRESSES comma-separated local source addresses to round-robin outgoing
 *                           connections across, e.g. 127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3,127.0.0.4
 *                           (default 127.0.0.1). Each address contributes its own ephemeral
 *                           source-port range, which is the only lever that moves the ~15,500 wall on
 *                           macOS. Non-primary loopback aliases must be created with sudo BEFORE the
 *                           run and removed after (see run-connection-ceiling.sh); the driver refuses
 *                           to start if any configured address is not bindable.
 * </pre>
 * Results are printed as one JSON document on stdout, after a human-readable table.
