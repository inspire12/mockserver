/**
 * G6 benchmark: the cost of the per-match hand-off to the shared matching thread pool, versus
 * evaluating the same regex inline.
 *
 * <p><b>The finding under test (G6).</b> Every non-literal matcher (regex path/method/header/query/
 * string-body, XPath, GraphQL {@code operationName}, JSON-RPC {@code method}, LLM conversation)
 * routes its evaluation through {@link MatchingTimeoutExecutor#callWithTimeout}, which submits the
 * real match to a JVM-wide {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} (SynchronousQueue, cap
 * {@code max(64, cores*16)}) and then <em>blocks the calling thread</em> on
 * {@code future.get(timeoutMillis, ...)}. The caller is a Netty event-loop thread (the
 * {@code HttpRequestHandler} is added to the pipeline with no {@code EventExecutorGroup}), and there
 * are a fixed 5 of those. It is on by default: {@code regexMatchingTimeoutMillis()} returns 5000.
 * The question is whether that hand-off — a thread wake-up, a {@code Future}, and a cross-thread
 * result copy for a match that is itself microscopically cheap — is a measurable tax, and whether it
 * worsens with concurrency.
 *
 * <p><b>What this benchmark measures.</b> {@code callWithTimeout} wrapping a representative-cheap
 * regex ({@code ^/regex/path-[a-z]+-\d+$} against a matching input), in two arms:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code mode=POOL} — {@code timeoutMillis=5000}, the shipped default: the match is submitted
 *       to the pool and the caller blocks on the future. This is the production path.</li>
 *   <li>{@code mode=INLINE} — {@code timeoutMillis=0}: {@code callWithTimeout}'s first line
 *       ({@code if (timeoutMillis <= 0) return task.call();}) evaluates the regex on the calling
 *       thread with no pool, no future, no cross-thread hop. This is the control, and it is exactly
 *       what setting {@code mockserver.regexMatchingTimeoutMillis=0} does in production (verified by
 *       reading {@code MatchingTimeoutExecutor.callWithTimeout} — 0 is not a magic sentinel, it is
 *       the {@code <= 0} disable branch).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Why call {@code callWithTimeout} directly</b> rather than driving {@code RegexStringMatcher}
 * or {@code RequestMatchers}: G6 is a statement about the executor hand-off specifically, so the
 * benchmark isolates that single operation around a fixed, cheap payload. Driving the full matcher
 * would fold in {@code NottableString} allocation, the pure-ASCII-literal short-circuit, and the
 * candidate-index scan — noise that the sibling {@code MatchingBenchmark} / {@code
 * CandidateIndexChurnBenchmark} already measure and that would dilute the hand-off signal. The
 * executor reached here is the identical {@code static} instance every production matcher submits
 * to; {@link MatchingTimeoutHandoffProof} confirms the real regex matchers call this same path.
 *
 * <p><b>A separate class, deliberately.</b> {@code MatchingBenchmark} is consumed by a daily CI gate
 * ({@code microbench.*.time_per_op} / {@code alloc_bytes_per_op}); adding a {@code @Threads} shape or
 * a new param to it would perturb that baseline and collide its result keys. This is a standalone
 * research benchmark, wired into no gate.
 *
 * <p><b>Threads.</b> The finding is about event-loop blocking and pool contention, so the thread
 * count is the primary dimension — set on the command line ({@code -t 1}, {@code -t 4}, {@code -t 8}),
 * exactly as the G1 churn benchmark does. {@code @Threads} is a single-valued annotation and cannot
 * be swept as a JMH param, so the run script drives the three counts as separate (sequential) forks.
 * At {@code -t 8} the peak in-flight task count is 8, far below the {@code max(64, cores*16)} pool
 * cap, so this benchmark never saturates the pool (confirmed by the per-trial {@code [g6]} line and
 * by {@link MatchingTimeoutHandoffProof}'s saturation check) — it measures hand-off cost under
 * contention, not the inline-fallback path.
 *
 * <p><b>Proof the arms take the path they claim</b> lives in {@link MatchingTimeoutHandoffProof}
 * (run first by {@code run-g6-handoff.sh}). In addition, the {@code [g6]} line printed at each trial
 * teardown reports the pool submissions that landed during that trial: a POOL trial reports a large
 * count (one per op, warmup included), an INLINE trial reports zero — a per-trial guard against a
 * silent false result from stale classes or a mis-set timeout.
 *
 * <pre>./run-g6-handoff.sh            # proof + JMH at -t 1,4,8 with -prof gc
 * ./run.sh MatchingTimeoutHandoffBenchmark -prof gc -f 1 -wi 5 -i 5 -t 4</pre>
