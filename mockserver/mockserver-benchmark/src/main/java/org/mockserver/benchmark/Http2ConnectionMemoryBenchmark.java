/**
 * HTTP/2 <em>per-connection memory</em> benchmark — the memory axis of issue #2669 (programme item 11).
 *
 * <p><strong>What it answers.</strong> The 8.0.0 changelog warned that migrating the HTTP/2 pipeline to
 * {@code Http2FrameCodec + Http2MultiplexHandler} — where every stream becomes its own child {@link Channel}
 * with its own pipeline — <em>changed per-connection memory</em>. {@link Http2StreamChannelBenchmark}
 * measures the throughput/latency of that design over ONE connection; this class adds the missing axis:
 * <b>N connections × M concurrent streams</b>, and records the <b>heap delta per established connection</b>.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>The measurement, and why it is trustworthy.</strong> For each shape {@code C×S}:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Force GC (via {@link MemoryMXBean#gc()} — a full collection) and read the retained heap
 *       ({@code HeapMemoryUsage.used}) as the baseline {@code H0}, with <em>no</em> client connections open.</li>
 *   <li>Open {@code C} real TCP connections, each carrying {@code S} concurrently in-flight streams. Each
 *       stream sends a complete request whose matched response is <b>held open by a long server-side delay</b>,
 *       so the server keeps {@code C×S} stream child channels alive simultaneously — the exact structures
 *       #2669 changed. Total concurrent server streams = {@code C×S}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Isolate connection cost from event-log cost.</b> MockServer retains full request/response bodies
 *       in a count-bounded event-log ring, so a naive heap delta would fold in logged bodies. Two things
 *       remove that confound: (a) the requests are bodyless {@code GET}s and the held responses never
 *       complete, so nothing large is retained; and (b) immediately before sampling we {@link ClearType#LOG
 *       clear the event log}, then confirm its occupancy is ~0. The sampled delta therefore cannot be
 *       log-body retention — it is connection + stream channel state.</li>
 *   <li>Force GC again, read {@code H1}. {@code bytes_per_connection = (H1 − H0) / C}.</li>
 *   <li>Close every connection, force GC, read {@code H2}. {@code H2} returning toward {@code H0} proves the
 *       delta was live connection state that is released on close (a leak would keep {@code H2} high).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Each shape is repeated {@code H2_MEM_REPEATS} times; the reported figure is the median with the sample
 * spread, so a single GC-timing outlier cannot masquerade as a result.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>The heap is the whole in-process JVM (client + server).</strong> The driver client and the mock
 * server share this JVM, so {@code bytes_per_connection} is the total retained heap per established connection
 * across both — an honest <em>trend</em> figure (a regression in either side shows up). Attributing the cost
 * specifically to the <em>server-side</em> multiplex change is what the cross-version comparison does: the
 * companion Docker/RSS harness (see {@code perf-test-h2multiplex.sh}) drives an identical external client
 * against a pre-8.0.0 image and an 8.0.0 image, holding the client side constant so the difference is the
 * server change the changelog named.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Self-validation is mandatory and fails the JVM loudly (exit code 2).</strong> A per-connection
 * memory number is only meaningful if the connections and streams were genuinely established and the log was
 * genuinely excluded. {@link ShapeResult#validate()} enforces, per shape:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>distinct connections</b> — the driver opened {@code C} sockets with {@code C} distinct local ports
 *       (a multiplexed client that silently collapsed them onto one connection fails here);</li>
 *   <li><b>streams established</b> — the server confirmed {@code C×S} concurrently in-flight requests. Because
 *       the server caps {@code MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS} at 100, {@code C×S} in flight is <em>physically
 *       impossible</em> on fewer than {@code ceil(C×S / 100)} connections — so this gate is an independent,
 *       protocol-level proof that the connection axis is real (e.g. 1000 in flight ⇒ ≥10 connections);</li>
 *   <li><b>log excluded</b> — the event-log occupancy sampled alongside {@code H1} is ~0 (below a small
 *       ceiling), so the delta is not logged bodies;</li>
 *   <li><b>plausible magnitude</b> — {@code bytes_per_connection} is above a floor (a near-zero delta means
 *       nothing was actually established/measured) and below a ceiling (a whole-heap delta means the harness
 *       measured the wrong thing).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>These are HARNESS-integrity gates, deliberately distinct from any performance threshold (there is none —
 * the metric is notify-only until its run-to-run variance is known). {@code selftest} proves every gate fires
 * on a fabricated bad result and that a clean result passes, server-free.</p>
 *

 * </pre>
 * <p>The {@code hold} mode is the external-client half of the Docker/RSS cross-version comparison: it opens
 * {@code C×S} in-flight streams against an already-running server, prints a {@code HELD} marker once the
 * server confirms them (so a shell can sample the container's RSS), holds for {@code dwellMs}, then releases.</p>
