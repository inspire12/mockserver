/**
 * Byte-cost micro-benchmark for the <b>CONNECT/relay response leg</b> — the proxy path the matcher
 * backstop says nothing about (performance-programme item 9c). A relayed message is decoded off the
 * downstream (server-facing) socket, re-aggregated, and re-encoded onto the upstream (client-facing)
 * socket; this benchmark drives exactly those codec steps in an {@link EmbeddedChannel} so that
 * <b>bytes/s</b> (from the {@code AverageTime} score) and <b>allocation per relayed KB</b> (from the
 * {@code -prof gc} {@code gc.alloc.rate.norm} bytes/op column) are derivable across a
 * {@link #bodySize} × {@link #readSize} sweep.
 *
 * <p><b>What is actually measured — the real relay components, not an imitation.</b> The two handlers
 * that appear in the CONNECT relay pipeline ({@code RelayConnectHandler#configurePipelines}) —
 * {@code UpstreamProxyRelayHandler} / {@code DownstreamProxyRelayHandler} — do <i>no</i> byte copying:
 * they {@code writeAndFlush} the already-decoded message by reference. The per-message work of the relay
 * lives in the codecs that flank them. This benchmark drives that real codec pair per relayed response:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>inbound (downstream server → MockServer):</b> {@link HttpResponseDecoder} (the decoder half
 *       of the {@code HttpClientCodec} on the loopback pipeline) feeding MockServer's own
 *       {@link StreamingAwareHttpObjectAggregator} in {@code relayOnly} mode — the exact aggregator
 *       instance the relay installs. A plain {@code application/octet-stream} response is used so the
 *       aggregator takes its standard (non-SSE) aggregation branch, which is the relayed-body path;</li>
 *   <li><b>outbound (MockServer → upstream client):</b> {@link HttpResponseEncoder} (the encoder half
 *       of the {@code HttpServerCodec} on the client-facing pipeline) re-serialising the aggregated
 *       {@link FullHttpResponse} back to wire bytes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The body is NOT copied — the cost is per-fragment, not per-byte (measured, not assumed).</b>
 * With {@code Content-Length} framing the decoder emits {@code HttpContent} objects that are
 * <i>retained slices</i> of the input buffer (no copy) and the aggregator assembles them into a
 * {@link CompositeByteBuf} whose components are added <i>by reference</i> (no copy). {@code setup()}
 * confirms this at runtime by printing the runtime class of {@code aggregated.content()} (a
 * {@code CompositeByteBuf}) once, outside the measured region. Consequently the body bytes are never
 * memcpy'd by the relay codecs, and the allocation that {@code gc.alloc.rate.norm} reports is
 * <b>proportional to the number of fragments</b> (one wrapper {@code ByteBuf}, one {@code HttpContent},
 * and one composite-component entry per fragment), plus a fixed per-message overhead (status/header
 * Strings, the {@code HttpResponse} objects, the encoder's header buffer). Fragment count is linear in
 * {@code bodySize} only when {@code readSize} is held fixed — which is exactly why an earlier
 * fixed-fragment version produced a clean straight line and <i>looked</i> like byte-proportional
 * copying. The decisive control is the {@link #readSize} sweep at a fixed {@code bodySize}: halving the
 * fragment size doubles the fragment count and (if the cost is per-fragment) roughly doubles alloc/op.
 * It does — see the module report. The {@link #fragmentWrappersOnly} control isolates how much of that
 * per-fragment allocation is the benchmark's own wrapper {@code ByteBuf}s versus the codec objects.
 *
 * <p><b>Fed like a socket, on purpose.</b> A large HTTP response never arrives in one read; the kernel
 * hands it to Netty in bounded segments and the decoder emits a slice per segment. Feeding the response
 * in one giant buffer would collapse the fragment count to one and understate the per-message object
 * churn a real relay pays. So the raw bytes are fed in {@link #readSize}-byte fragments, and
 * {@code readSize} is swept so the per-fragment nature of the cost is visible rather than hidden. The
 * channels are reused across invocations, modelling a keep-alive CONNECT tunnel relaying many responses.
 *
 * <p><b>What this does NOT cover</b> (be explicit — do not read more into the number than is here):
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The socket read copy is omitted entirely.</b> In production the kernel→userspace socket read
 *       copies every body byte into a (pooled) receive buffer before the decoder ever sees it — a real,
 *       unavoidable per-byte relay cost. This benchmark hands the decoder {@code wrappedBuffer} views
 *       over a pre-existing array, so that per-byte copy is <b>not measured at all</b>. The number here
 *       is the relay's <i>object/aggregation</i> cost above the socket, not its total per-byte cost;</li>
 *   <li><b>The wrapper {@code ByteBuf}s are themselves counted allocations.</b> Each fragment is wrapped
 *       in an {@code Unpooled.wrappedBuffer} view, and those wrapper objects are per-fragment allocations
 *       included in {@code gc.alloc.rate.norm}. They are a faithful stand-in for the per-read receive
 *       buffer a socket relay allocates (see above), not an artefact to be subtracted; the
 *       {@link #fragmentWrappersOnly} control measures their share on the machine it runs on, and
 *       that figure is a LOWER BOUND: in the control the wrappers do not escape, so the JIT may
 *       scalar-replace them, whereas in {@link #relayResponse} each one escapes into the decoder;</li>
 *   <li>no sockets, no TLS, no event-loop hand-off, no flow-control/backpressure — a single-threaded,
 *       in-JVM codec measurement, not an end-to-end throughput figure;</li>
 *   <li>only the HTTP/1.1 aggregating relay leg. Out of scope: the SSE/streaming relay
 *       ({@code StreamingResponseRelayHandler}), the HTTP/2 relay, raw CONNECT-tunnel byte pumping
 *       (opaque TLS bytes, no HTTP codec at all), SOCKS, and content de/recompression;</li>
 *   <li>the request leg (client → server) is not separately measured; the response leg is representative
 *       and carries the large bodies.</li>
 * </ul>
