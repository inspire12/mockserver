/**
 * G1 benchmark: the cost of {@link RequestMatchers#firstMatchingExpectation} when the
 * expectation store is being MUTATED (churned), versus a STATIC store.
 *
 * <p><b>The finding under test (G1).</b> {@code CircularPriorityQueue.toSortedList()} caches
 * the sorted matcher snapshot and INVALIDATES it on every structural mutation; in parallel the
 * {@link RequestMatchers} modification counter bumps on every mutation and
 * {@code CandidateIndex} rebuilds whenever its generation is stale. So a single mutation
 * forces the NEXT request to rebuild both the full sorted list and (when engaged) the
 * candidate index. Because the serving path itself schedules lazy removal of inactive
 * ({@code once()} / limited-{@code Times}) matchers, a workload of consumable expectations
 * mutates the store continuously — every request then pays a rebuild.
 *
 * <p><b>What this benchmark measures.</b> The per-request cost and per-request allocation of
 * {@code firstMatchingExpectation} for a HIT, in four arms crossed with size {@code n}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code mode=STATIC} — the store is built once and never mutated: every request reuses
 *       the cached sorted list (and, in INDEX mode, the built buckets). This is the baseline.</li>
 *   <li>{@code mode=CHURN} — a SINGLE background writer thread continuously removes and re-adds a
 *       dedicated churn expectation through the real {@code clear(id)} / {@code add} control-plane
 *       API. Each such mutation invalidates the cached sorted list (bumping its generation) and
 *       bumps the {@link RequestMatchers} modification counter exactly as the serving path's lazy
 *       removal does — so reader requests find the cache invalidated and rebuild. A single writer honours the {@code CircularPriorityQueue}
 *       single-writer contract; the reader threads use only the (concurrency-safe) read path.</li>
 *   <li>{@code indexMode=SCAN} — candidate index disabled (threshold above n): the reader
 *       rebuilds only the full sorted list under churn.</li>
 *   <li>{@code indexMode=INDEX} — candidate index engaged (threshold 2): the reader rebuilds the
 *       full sorted list AND the candidate index under churn.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Threads.</b> The reader thread count is set on the command line ({@code -t 1}, {@code -t 4},
 * {@code -t 8}). The finding claims the cost WORSENS with more cores because
 * {@code toSortedList()}'s cache is lock-free: each concurrent reader that finds the cache
 * invalidated rebuilds the whole list independently (duplicate work, never a stale result). Only a multi-thread run can show that.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT measure.</b> It fixes {@code outcome=HIT} (the rebuild happens before
 * the scan, so a MISS tells the same rebuild story with a longer SCAN tail — omitted to bound
 * the matrix). It does not model a partially-warm cache (the writer churns full-tilt, i.e. the
 * WORST-CASE continuous churn a high-throughput {@code once()} workload produces); a
 * rate-limited writer would interpolate between STATIC and this worst case. Absolute
 * magnitudes are from a contended laptop — read the STATIC-vs-CHURN and 1-vs-N-thread RATIOS,
 * not the raw microseconds.
 *
 * <p><b>Proof the churn arm actually rebuilds</b> (not assumed) lives in
 * {@code org.mockserver.mock.CandidateIndexChurnRebuildProof} — a package-private verifier that
 * shows (a) the writer's mutation bumps the modification counter and (b) it makes
 * {@code toSortedList()} return a fresh instance, while a static store returns the same
 * instance. The {@code [churn]} line printed at trial teardown reports how many writer
 * mutations landed during the run.
 *
