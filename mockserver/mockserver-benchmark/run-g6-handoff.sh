# G6 research benchmark: the per-match hand-off to the shared matching thread pool
# (MatchingTimeoutExecutor.callWithTimeout — submit + block a Netty event-loop thread on future.get)
# versus evaluating the same regex inline (regexMatchingTimeoutMillis=0).
# See MatchingTimeoutHandoffBenchmark (JMH) and MatchingTimeoutHandoffProof (the mechanism proof).
#
# This is a RESEARCH benchmark — it is NOT wired into any CI gate.
#
#   ./run-g6-handoff.sh               # proof + the three thread-count JMH runs (t=1,4,8)
#   ./run-g6-handoff.sh proof         # just the pool-on/off + saturation proof (fast, no JMH)
#   ./run-g6-handoff.sh 4             # just the JMH POOL-vs-INLINE matrix at -t 4
#
# One-time prerequisite (install core from THIS worktree so the benchmark measures this source):
#   (cd .. && mvn -o -pl mockserver-core install -DskipTests -Djacoco.skip=true)
