# G1 research benchmark: candidate-index / sorted-list REBUILD cost under expectation churn.
# See CandidateIndexChurnBenchmark (JMH) and CandidateIndexChurnRebuildProof (the mechanism proof).
#
# TWO ways to run this:
#
#   RESEARCH (free-form, prints JMH tables to stdout — NOT gated):
#     ./run-g1-churn.sh                 # proof + the three thread-count JMH runs (t=1,4,8)
#     ./run-g1-churn.sh proof           # just the rebuild-proof (fast, no JMH)
#     ./run-g1-churn.sh 1               # just the JMH matrix at -t 1
#   One-time prerequisite for the research modes (install core from THIS worktree so the
#   benchmark measures this source):
#     (cd .. && mvn -o -pl mockserver-core install -DskipTests -Djacoco.skip=true)
#
#   CI (machine-readable contract file for the daily perf gate — SELF-CONTAINED build):
#     ./run-g1-churn.sh ci              # emits perf-churn.json {churn:{alloc_ratio_index_n15000, ...}}
#   Driven by .buildkite/scripts/steps/perf-test-microbench.sh. Mirror of run-scaling.sh:
#   it builds mockserver-netty + its upstream reactor deps (the benchmark module depends on
#   BOTH core and netty, and -am builds a module's upstream only, so targeting core alone
#   leaves netty missing), runs the rebuild PROOF as a mechanism sanity check, then runs the
#   ONE gated arm (n=15,000, indexMode=INDEX, mode=STATIC vs CHURN, -t 1, JMH -foe true) and
#   reshapes the churn/static ALLOCATION ratio into the contract file. The FAIL-CLOSED guard
#   that a CHURN arm actually churned (rather than silently degrading to static when its daemon
#   writer thread dies, which would land the ratio at ~1.0 and pass the 1.5 floor green) lives
#   in the benchmark's own @TearDown: it throws on unhealthy churn signals, and -foe true makes
#   that JMH error exit non-zero so `set -e` reds the step. The ratio is a within-run A/B
#   (the CandidateIndexBenchmark gold-standard shape) so it cancels host/JVM/GC noise and is
#   machine-independent — allocation is bytes/op, not timing. A regression that reintroduced
#   rebuild-on-read would move it ~1.06x -> ~1000x+ (three orders of magnitude).

  # MECHANISM SANITY CHECK (supplementary, NOT the dead-writer guard). CandidateIndexChurnRebuildProof
  # is a SYNCHRONOUS, main-thread check: it does a manual clear+add and asserts the mutation bumps
  # the store's modification counter AND makes toSortedList() return a fresh instance, while a static
  # store reuses its cached one. It confirms the rebuild MECHANISM the benchmark relies on still
  # works (e.g. catches a refactor that stopped nulling sortedCache). It does NOT — and cannot —
  # observe the benchmark's daemon WRITER THREAD, which is the thing the measured CHURN arm depends
  # on. The guard against a silently-static CHURN arm (dead writer -> ratio ~1.0 -> false green) is
