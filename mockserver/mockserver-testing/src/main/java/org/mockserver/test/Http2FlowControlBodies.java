/**
 * Size-parameterised, deterministic response bodies for HTTP/2 integration tests.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Four HTTP/2 defects (GitHub #2641, #2667, #2669, #2683) all shipped while
 * every HTTP/2 test was green, for one structural reason: <b>every HTTP/2 test used a response body
 * smaller than the {@value #FLOW_CONTROL_WINDOW_BYTES}-byte flow-control window</b> — including the one
 * literally named {@code shouldForwardHttp2RequestWithLargeBodyViaConnectProxy} at 50,000 bytes. A body
 * that fits in the peer's first window is delivered without any {@code WINDOW_UPDATE}, so the
 * {@code writePendingBytes()} flush those defects live in is never exercised, and the whole family of
 * bugs — whose failure mode is a <b>silent hang</b>, not a wrong answer — is invisible. See
 * {@code docs/code/netty-pipeline.md} ("Testing convention: an HTTP/2 test MUST use a response body
 * larger than the flow-control window").
 *
 * <p><b>What this gives you.</b> A named set of sizes ({@link Size#SMALL}, {@link Size#OVER_WINDOW},
 * {@link Size#LARGE}) so a new HTTP/2 test crosses the window <b>by construction</b> — the author picks
 * {@code OVER_WINDOW} without having to know the 65,535-byte history or type a magic number. Bodies are
 * <b>deterministic and distinguishable</b>: the content is stamped throughout with a caller-supplied
 * marker, so a mis-routed body (delivered on the wrong h2 stream) or a truncated body fails an
 * <em>equality</em> assertion, not merely a length check.
 *
 * <p>Lives in {@code mockserver-testing} (package {@code org.mockserver.test}) rather than in a single
 * test tree because it is a compile-scope dependency of {@code mockserver-integration-testing} and a
 * test dependency of {@code mockserver-netty}, {@code mockserver-war} and the rest — so every module
 * with HTTP/2 tests can reach it. It has no dependency beyond the JDK.
