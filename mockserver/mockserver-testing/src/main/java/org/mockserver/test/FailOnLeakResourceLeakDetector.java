/**
 * A Netty {@link ResourceLeakDetector} that turns a detected reference-counted resource leak
 * (a {@code ByteBuf} that was allocated and never released) into something the BUILD can fail
 * on, instead of an ERROR line buried in the log that a green run happily ignores.
 * <p>
 * Install it in the test JVM with:
 * <pre>
 *   -Dio.netty.leakDetection.level=paranoid
 *   -Dio.netty.customResourceLeakDetector=org.mockserver.test.FailOnLeakResourceLeakDetector
 *   -Dmockserver.leakReportDir=&lt;a directory under target/&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Netty's {@code ResourceLeakDetectorFactory} instantiates one instance per tracked resource
 * type, preferring the {@code (Class,int,long)} constructor and falling back to
 * {@code (Class,int)} — both are provided below.
 * <p>
 * <b>How it lets the build fail.</b> Every leak Netty reports to this detector is (a) counted,
 * (b) still logged by Netty at ERROR via {@code super}, and (c) <em>written to a file</em>
 * {@code <leakReportDir>/leak-<pid>.txt}. A Maven {@code antrun} step (see the parent pom's
 * {@code check-netty-leaks}) then fails the build if that directory contains any non-empty file,
 * or if tests ran and no fork wrote an installed marker (see {@link #INSTALLED_MARKER_PREFIX}). A file survives the
 * fork exiting, so this does not depend on JUnit/surefire notification semantics (throwing from
 * a RunListener does NOT fail surefire — it is caught and reported as a listener warning).
 * <p>
 * <b>Flushing.</b> Netty only reports a leak once the leaked object has been GC-collected AND a
 * subsequent {@code track()} polls the reference queue. During a busy suite that happens
 * naturally as later allocations poll the queue. To also catch buffers leaked late in a fork,
 * this class registers (once) a JVM shutdown hook that forces a GC and allocates/releases a few
 * buffers so the queue is polled and any straggler is written before the fork exits.
 * <p>
 * <b>What it cannot catch.</b> A buffer that is never GC-collected before the JVM exits, or one
 * whose leak is reported on a background thread after the shutdown hook has run, will not reach
 * the file. Netty still logs it at ERROR with a {@code LEAK:} prefix; that log is the only
 * remaining signal for such a tail case.
