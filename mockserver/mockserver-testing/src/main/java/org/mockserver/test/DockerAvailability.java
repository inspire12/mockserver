/**
 * Fail-safe wrapper for the Docker availability probe used by Docker-gated tests.
 * <p>
 * Docker-gated suites are written as:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Assume.assumeTrue("Docker is not available",
 *     DockerAvailability.isAvailable(() -> DockerClientFactory.instance().isDockerAvailable()));
 * }</pre>
 * so they SKIP where Docker is unusable and RUN where it is usable. That design only holds if
 * the probe yields a boolean in every circumstance.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Testcontainers' own probe does not.</strong>
 * {@code DockerClientFactory.isDockerAvailable()} is documented as "true if Docker is
 * available, false if not", but is implemented as
 * {@code try { client(); return true; } catch (IllegalStateException ex) { return false; }} —
 * only {@link IllegalStateException} becomes {@code false}. {@code client()} does much more
 * than connect: it starts the Ryuk reaper via {@code ResourceReaper.instance().init()} and runs
 * version/mount checks, and those stages throw types that are NOT {@code IllegalStateException}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code com.github.dockerjava.api.exception.BadRequestException} (a
 *       {@code DockerException}, hence a plain {@code RuntimeException}) — e.g. a daemon with
 *       user-namespace remapping rejecting Ryuk's privileged container with
 *       "privileged mode is incompatible with user namespaces";</li>
 *   <li>{@code ContainerFetchException} / {@code ContainerLaunchException} — Ryuk's image cannot
 *       be pulled, or its container cannot start;</li>
 *   <li>{@link Error}s such as {@link NoClassDefFoundError} or
 *       {@code ExceptionInInitializerError} — an incomplete or conflicting test classpath.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Any of these escapes the probe and turns "no usable Docker" into a hard ERROR, defeating the
 * {@code assume} guard everywhere it is used — in CI, and equally for a contributor whose Docker
 * is configured unusually. Testcontainers also caches the failure in {@code cachedClientFailure}
 * and rethrows it on every later call, so a single bad probe fails every Docker-gated test in
 * the JVM.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Why a {@link BooleanSupplier} rather than calling Testcontainers directly:</strong>
 * this module is the shared testing utility module and deliberately depends on almost nothing
 * (JUnit and Hamcrest only). Adding Testcontainers here purely for this helper would widen that
 * surface for every consumer, which the repository-wide {@code dependencyConvergence} enforcer
 * rule makes a real risk. Taking the probe as a lambda keeps one shared implementation without
 * the coupling, and keeps it compile-time type-safe — a reflective lookup would silently degrade
 * to "unavailable" if the method were renamed, silently skipping every Docker-gated test, which
 * is the exact failure mode this helper exists to prevent.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pass a lambda, not a method reference.</strong> Use
 * {@code () -> DockerClientFactory.instance().isDockerAvailable()} rather than
 * {@code DockerClientFactory.instance()::isDockerAvailable}: a method reference evaluates
 * {@code instance()} eagerly at the call site, outside this class's try/catch, so a failure
 * constructing the factory would still escape.
 * <p>
 * <strong>In CI, pair this with a fail-closed assertion.</strong> Being fail-SAFE is a deliberate
 * trade: an unusable Docker becomes a SKIP rather than an ERROR, which is right off-CI but is a
 * silent false positive in CI, where skipping proves nothing. Note this WIDENS the silent-skip
 * surface for a suite that previously guarded with {@code catch (Exception e)}, because an
 * {@link Error} used to escape that catch and fail loudly. Every Docker-gated suite that runs in CI
 * should therefore have its surefire/failsafe reports covered by
 * {@code .buildkite/scripts/steps/assert-suite-ran.sh}, which fails the build when a report shows
 * zero tests or all-skipped.
 * <p>
 * COVERAGE: all nine Docker-gated suites are covered — the three cloud blob-store contract suites by
 * {@code java-cloud-store-test.sh}, the five {@code *LiveBrokerIntegrationTest} suites in
 * {@code mockserver-async} by {@code java-async-broker-test.sh}, and
 * {@code MockServerContainerIntegrationTest} in {@code mockserver-testcontainers} by
 * {@code java-testcontainers-test.sh}. That last suite was previously named
 * {@code MockServerContainerIT} — a class ending {@code IT} matched neither Surefire
 * ({@code **}{@code /*Test.java}) nor Failsafe ({@code **}{@code /*IntegrationTest.java}), so it
 * executed nowhere and needed no assertion. Renaming it to {@code *IntegrationTest} makes Failsafe
 * collect it, so it now runs — and, like every other Docker-gated suite, would otherwise SKIP
 * silently in the socket-free main build, so it gets its own socket-bearing step with an
 * {@code assert-suite-ran.sh} guard (see {@code docs/code/client-and-integrations.md}).
 * <p>
 * WHY THE ASYNC STEP EXISTS — a diagnosis worth keeping, because the failure was invisible. Those
 * five suites WERE invoked in the main build (Failsafe's include matches them, and the main build
 * runs {@code clean install}, which reaches {@code verify}) but SKIPPED EVERY TEST ON EVERY RUN,
 * because the main build deliberately runs without a Docker socket — the socket-bearing work is
 * split into its own step since {@code run-in-docker.sh} exit-0s a socket step on PR builds.
 * Confirmed from Buildkite: the {@code :maven: build} job passed (exit 0) in mockserver-java builds
 * #1580 and #1583, each reporting
 * {@code failsafe:integration-test @ mockserver-async → Tests run: 5, Skipped: 5}. (Both builds
 * failed overall, on the separate cloud blob-store step — a green job that tested nothing is exactly
 * the false positive being removed here.)
 * <p>
 * The lesson generalises: "collected" is not "executed", and an include pattern is not evidence a
 * suite tests anything. Note also the ordering — adding {@code assert-suite-ran.sh} over those five
 * BEFORE supplying the socket would have turned the pipeline permanently red rather than closing a
 * gap. A fail-closed assertion is only safe once the suite can actually pass.
