/**
 * One binary client connection's single upstream connection, and the bytes relayed between the two as they arrive.
 * Kept in a channel attribute of the client connection. The upstream connection is registered on the client
 * connection's event loop, so everything here runs on that one thread; only the listener runs elsewhere.
 * <p>
 * Neither connection is read while the other cannot take what is read from it, so what is held is one read each
 * way, each connection's write buffer and the messages not yet reported to the listener.
 * <p>
 * When the client turns TLS on part way through (PostgreSQL's {@code SSLRequest}), MockServer answers the client's
 * handshake as it does for any TLS connection and starts its own handshake with the upstream on the same upstream
 * connection, so what was sent before goes up in the clear and everything after over TLS. A client whose connection
 * was TLS from its first byte gets an upstream connection that is TLS from its first byte too.
 * <p>
 * The upstream connection is made directly or through a tunnel ({@code forwardSocksProxy}, {@code forwardHttpsProxy}).
 * A connection this cannot carry, one whose only upstream proxy is {@code forwardHttpProxy}, is left to the caller,
 * which forwards each of its messages on an upstream connection of its own: see {@link #decideOnce()}.
