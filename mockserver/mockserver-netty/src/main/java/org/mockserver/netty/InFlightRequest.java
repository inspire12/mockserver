/**
 * Per-request in-flight token used by the WS7.2 graceful-shutdown connection drain.
 *
 * <p>A token is created and {@link LifeCycle#requestProcessingStarted()} is incremented exactly once
 * when a data-plane HTTP request begins processing in {@link HttpRequestHandler#channelRead0}. The
 * matching {@link LifeCycle#requestProcessingComplete()} decrement is driven by {@link #complete()},
 * which is invoked from whichever of these fires first:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the response funnel — {@code NettyResponseWriter.sendResponse(...)}, through which most
 *       data-plane responses flow (normal, streaming, chunked, forward/proxy, error/exception,
 *       breakpoint-modified); or</li>
 *   <li>the end of a response an action handler writes straight to the channel (SSE, WebSocket, gRPC
 *       stream, raw-bytes error), which that handler reports through the callback
 *       {@code NettyResponseWriter.respondingDirectly()} returns, so another exchange's end on the same
 *       connection cannot release it; or</li>
 *   <li>the channel {@code closeFuture} safety net — covers requests that never produce a response
 *       (connection drop or pipeline-killing exception mid-processing).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A single compare-and-set guard guarantees the decrement fires <em>exactly once</em> regardless
 * of how many of those hooks fire, so the in-flight counter can never leak (which would make
 * {@code stop()} always wait the full drain timeout) nor be decremented twice.</p>
 *
 * <p>The token is its own {@link ChannelFutureListener} (rather than capturing a separate lambda per
 * request), so the only per-request allocation for the safety net is this object itself.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Listener lifecycle.</strong> The {@code closeFuture} safety net is registered via
 * {@link #trackConnectionClose(Channel)}. On an HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connection the handler sits on
 * the <em>connection</em> channel, whose {@code closeFuture} completes only when the whole
 * connection closes — potentially after thousands of requests. A listener added to a future is
 * retained by that future until it completes, so if the safety-net listener were never removed,
 * every completed request on a long-lived connection would leave its listener (the token) pinned for
 * the life of the connection — an unbounded, per-request heap leak. To prevent that, this token
 * remembers the {@code closeFuture} it registered on and, the first time {@link #complete()} wins the
 * CAS, <em>removes</em> itself from that future. After that only a genuine no-response close
 * (connection drop / pipeline-killing exception) still relies on the listener firing, and in that
 * case the listener has already run. Under HTTP/2 the handler sits on a per-stream child channel
 * whose {@code closeFuture} completes per request, so the listener would be freed naturally there
 * anyway; removing it on completion is correct on both paths and simply frees it sooner on
 * HTTP/1.1.</p>
