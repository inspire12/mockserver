/**
 * Behavioural guard that the configuration property {@code maxResponseBodySize} is actually enforced
 * against a body received from an <em>upstream</em> while MockServer is forwarding, and that the
 * <em>configured</em> value — not an unbounded aggregator — is the one that decides.
 * <p>
 * Before this test the property had no behavioural coverage at all: it is read when a forward-client
 * pipeline is built, so a regression that dropped the wiring — or passed {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} instead
 * of the configured value — would have removed a documented, memory-protecting bound with nothing turning
 * red. Only the inbound analogue {@code maxRequestBodySize} was verified end-to-end.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Scope of this test.</strong> The property has three read sites, and this test covers the first:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code HttpClientInitializer.configureHttp1Pipeline} sizes the HTTP/1.1 forward
 *       {@code StreamingAwareHttpObjectAggregator} from it — <em>covered here</em>;</li>
 *   <li>{@code Http2ForwardStreamChildInitializer} sizes the HTTP/2 <em>per-stream</em> forward aggregator
 *       from the same property — <em>not covered</em>; and</li>
 *   <li>{@code HttpClientInitializer.configureHttp2Pipeline} derives the HTTP/2 client's
 *       {@code maxFrameSize} from it — <em>not covered</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * So the property is proven to be enforced on the HTTP/1.1 forward path only; nothing here proves the
 * HTTP/2 forward path honours it.
 * <p>
 * <strong>What the limit actually does, observed end-to-end.</strong> The forward-client aggregator is a
 * Netty {@code HttpObjectAggregator} sized from {@code maxResponseBodySize}. When the upstream response
 * body exceeds it, Netty closes the upstream channel and raises a {@code TooLongFrameException}; that
 * propagates to {@code HttpClientHandler.exceptionCaught}, which completes the forward's response future
 * exceptionally, and {@code HttpActionHandler} converts a failed forward into a
 * <strong>502 Bad Gateway</strong> returned to the client. The oversized upstream body is therefore never
 * relayed — the client sees a gateway error, not a truncated or a complete payload. That is the behaviour
 * pinned here; it is not a documented contract elsewhere, so it is asserted as observed.
 * <p>
 * The test drives a real socket against a real forwarding MockServer, with a raw {@link ServerSocket}
 * upstream that returns a body whose size is chosen by the request path:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>control</strong> — a body comfortably under the configured limit is forwarded intact
 *       (200, every byte present), proving the limit does not simply break forwarding; and</li>
 *   <li><strong>over-limit, {@code Content-Length}</strong> — a body far over the limit, declared by
 *       {@code Content-Length}, is rejected with a 502 and none of the payload reaches the client; and</li>
 *   <li><strong>over-limit, chunked</strong> — the same oversized payload sent with
 *       {@code Transfer-Encoding: chunked} and no {@code Content-Length}, so the limit is proven to be
 *       enforced against the bytes actually accumulated and not merely against a declared header.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The oversized body (64KB) is far below the 50MB product default, so the test is a genuine positive
 * control: restoring an unbounded aggregator (or falling back to the default) lets the oversized body
 * through with a 200 and turns the over-limit assertions red.
