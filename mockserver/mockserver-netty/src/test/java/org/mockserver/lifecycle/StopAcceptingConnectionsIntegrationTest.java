/**
 * Graceful shutdown must stop accepting NEW connections before it drains the in-flight ones.
 * <p>
 * These are <strong>regression guards for behaviour that is already correct</strong>, not tests
 * for a known defect. A suspected bug here -- that {@code LifeCycle} closing its server channels
 * with {@code disconnect()} left the listening socket open on NIO, because
 * {@code NioServerSocketChannel.doDisconnect()} throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException} --
 * was investigated and <strong>disproved</strong>. The pipeline translates disconnect into close
 * before reaching the channel: {@code AbstractChannelHandlerContext.disconnect()} opens with
 * {@code if (!channel().metadata().hasDisconnect()) return close(promise);}, and a server
 * channel's metadata is {@code new ChannelMetadata(false, 16)}. See the comment at the call site
 * in {@code LifeCycle}. There is no platform divergence: epoll reaches {@code close()} via
 * {@code doDisconnect() -> doClose()}, NIO via the pipeline translation.
 * <p>
 * The tests are kept because someone removing or altering the channel close is a real risk, and
 * this is what would catch it.
 * <p>
 * Two design points make them meaningful rather than decorative:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>They assert the <strong>observable</strong> -- can a fresh TCP client still connect --
 *       rather than the mechanism, so they stay valid however the socket comes to be closed.</li>
 *   <li>The refusal poll window is deliberately much SHORTER than the in-flight delay, and
 *       {@code stopFuture.isDone()} is asserted false. Without both, the test passes for the wrong
 *       reason: an earlier version used a 5s poll against a 3s drain and observed the socket
 *       closing during post-drain event-loop teardown, so it passed even when the listening socket
 *       was never closed at shutdown. It was validated with a positive control -- replacing the
 *       close with {@code newSucceededFuture()} so the socket genuinely never closes turns it
 *       red.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The test pins {@code useNativeTransport=false} so it exercises the NIO path explicitly on every
 * platform, including Linux CI.
