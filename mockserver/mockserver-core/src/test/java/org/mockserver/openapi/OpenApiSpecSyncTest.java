/**
 * Drift guard for the two copies of the MockServer OpenAPI specification.
 *
 * <p>The control-plane REST API is described by one specification that lives in the repository
 * twice, because two different consumers need it in two different places:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>{@code jekyll-www.mock-server.com/mockserver-openapi.yaml}</strong> — published on
 *       the documentation site, and named the single source of truth by
 *       {@code scripts/collections/generate_collections.py}, which derives the Postman and Bruno
 *       collections from it (gated in CI by {@code .buildkite/scripts/steps/collections-validate.sh}).</li>
 *   <li><strong>{@code mockserver/mockserver-core/src/main/resources/org/mockserver/openapi/mock-server-openapi-embedded-model.yaml}</strong>
 *       — bundled into the jar and served at runtime from {@code GET /mockserver/openapi.yaml} by
 *       {@code OpenAPISpecHandler}, and uploaded to SwaggerHub by
 *       {@code scripts/release/components/swaggerhub.sh}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The jekyll copy sits outside {@code mockserver/pom.xml}'s module set, so no Maven module
 * compiles, copies, or compares it, and the embedded copy is a plain classpath resource that
 * nothing regenerates. Both files declare the same {@code info.version} — {@code prepare.sh} bumps
 * both on every release — so a version comparison cannot detect divergence either. The result is
 * that the two copies drifted apart silently and in <em>both</em> directions: the jekyll copy grew
 * control-plane paths the embedded copy never received, while the embedded copy grew model
 * properties the jekyll copy never received. A running MockServer then hands out a specification
 * that omits most of its own API.
 *
 * <p>This test is the missing validation. It asserts the two files are byte-identical, which is the
 * strongest and simplest form of the invariant: there is one specification, stored twice. Byte
 * equality survives the release process unchanged, because {@code prepare.sh} rewrites the same
 * {@code info.version} into both files in the same commit.
 *
 * <p>On failure the assertion message reports the structural difference (paths and schemas present
 * in one copy but not the other) before falling back to a byte diff, so the fix is obvious rather
 * than requiring a manual diff of two 5,000-line YAML files.
 *
 * <p>Follows the same shape as {@code LegacyBackstopFileSyncTest}: plain JUnit, Docker-free, and it
 * locates the repository root by walking up from the module basedir so it is independent of the
 * working directory Surefire launches with.
 *
 * <p><strong>What this test does not guard.</strong> It compares one copy of the specification to
 * the other. It says nothing about whether either copy matches the Java model, so a property that
 * exists in {@code ExpectationDTO} but in neither copy is invisible here. That gap was real when
 * this test was written — eleven {@code Expectation} properties, covering the LLM, gRPC streaming,
 * gRPC bidi, binary and DNS actions plus forward validation, forward fallback, before/after actions,
 * multi-step expectations and capture rules, were declared in neither copy. It is now closed and
 * guarded by {@link OpenApiSpecExpectationSchemaTest}, which drives the comparison from the DTO.
 *
 * <p><strong>Correction.</strong> An earlier version of this javadoc claimed that because the schema
 * is {@code additionalProperties: false}, the specification "rejects valid LLM, gRPC, binary and DNS
 * expectations". That was wrong, and it is worth stating plainly because the mistake is an easy one
 * to repeat: this YAML is <em>documentation</em>. {@code OpenAPISpecHandler} serves its bytes
 * verbatim and never parses it, and nothing else on the runtime path reads it. Incoming expectation
 * JSON is validated against a different artefact entirely —
 * {@code org/mockserver/model/schema/expectation.json}, loaded by
 * {@code JsonSchemaExpectationValidator} — which does declare all eleven, so those expectations
 * always validated and were always accepted. The cost of spec drift is borne by consumers of the
 * specification (documentation readers, generated clients, external validators, and the Postman and
 * Bruno collections), not by the server.
