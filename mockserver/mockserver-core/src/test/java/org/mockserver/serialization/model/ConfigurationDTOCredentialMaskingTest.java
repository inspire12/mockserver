/**
 * Security guard for WRITE-ONLY credential configuration properties.
 *
 * <p>These properties are fully settable — over the {@code Configuration} instance and over
 * {@code PUT /mockserver/configuration} — but their credential content must never be readable:
 * {@code GET /mockserver/configuration} returns {@link ConfigurationProperties#REDACTED_VALUE} in
 * its place.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes are covered, and both are enumerated from {@link #WRITE_ONLY_CREDENTIALS}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>whole-value</strong> credentials, whose entire value is the secret, mask to the bare
 *       {@link ConfigurationProperties#REDACTED_VALUE};</li>
 *   <li><strong>value-embedded</strong> credentials, which carry a secret inside a structured value
 *       (a {@code k=v} header list, a JSON document), mask <em>per header / per field</em> — the
 *       surrounding, non-secret configuration must survive intact.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Four distinct failures are asserted, because masking a secret is easy to get half-right:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Leak</strong> — the real secret appearing anywhere in the serialized configuration.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Over-masking</strong> — a partial mask swallowing the non-secret configuration around
 *       it, so an operator can no longer read back the headers/backends they configured.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Round-trip destruction</strong> — a client doing GET-then-PUT of the whole blob writing
 *       the literal mask back over a working credential. This is the classic bug in the masking pattern:
 *       the secret does not leak, it is silently destroyed instead.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Broken functionality</strong> — masking that also blocks the write path, leaving the
 *       credential unsettable.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Enumeration is reflective over {@link #WRITE_ONLY_CREDENTIALS} so adding a credential to the list
 * without masking it fails here, and masking one without listing it fails in
 * {@link ConfigurationEnforcementClassificationTest#shouldKeepTheWriteOnlyCredentialListInSyncWithTheMaskingGuard()}.
