/**
 * Build-time guard that keeps {@link HttpState#isControlPlanePathCandidate(String)} in step with the
 * routes it gates.
 *
 * <p><b>The hazard.</b> The gate is a hand-maintained allow-list consulted as a fast reject before
 * the two dispatch chains. Returning {@code true} for a non-route is harmless, but returning
 * {@code false} for a real control-plane route makes that route silently unreachable — a 404-shaped
 * failure with no exception and no log.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the corpus test is not enough.</b>
 * {@code HttpStateControlPlaneGateTest#everyControlPlanePathIsACandidate} asserts the gate accepts
 * every alias <em>listed in that test</em>. Both it and the gate are hand-written copies of the same
 * routing table, so a route added to {@code HttpState.handle} without touching either stays green in
 * both. This guard closes that gap by deriving the expected set from the routing source itself, so
 * the check is bound to the thing it guards rather than to a second copy of the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Honest limitations — a text scanner, not a Java parser.</b> It recognises the two shapes the
 * routing chains actually use: the canonical two-form
 * {@code matches("METHOD", PATH_PREFIX + "/x", "/x")} call, and trailing-slash path literals that
 * denote {@code {name}}-style route prefixes. Comments are stripped before scanning, so prose
 * mentioning a path cannot make the prefix scan demand a gate entry for it. It therefore MISSES a route whose bare alias is built
 * at runtime, held in a variable or constant, or written in a shape not listed above. A prefixed-only
 * route (no bare alias) needs no entry and is intentionally not scanned, being covered by the gate's
 * {@code PATH_PREFIX} rule. The fail-closed minimums below mean a regex that stops matching breaks
 * the build rather than passing vacuously.
