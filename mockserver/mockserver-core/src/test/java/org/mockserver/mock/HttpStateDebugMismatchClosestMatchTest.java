/**
 * {@code POST /mockserver/debugMismatch} must report the <b>closest</b> expectation, ranked by how
 * much of the request actually matched — not by registration order.
 *
 * <p><b>Fixture design.</b> In these tests the closest expectation is deliberately <b>not</b> the first
 * one registered — <i>except</i> in {@link #shouldReportTheSameClosestExpectationRegardlessOfRegistrationOrder()},
 * which is a declared control and must stay as it is. That ordering is the whole point: request matching
 * fails fast on the first non-matching field, so each mismatched expectation records exactly one differing
 * field and every candidate ties on the raw difference count. A tie is resolved by whichever was seen
 * first, so a fixture whose closest expectation happens to be registered first passes whether the ranking
 * works or not.
 *
 * <p>Against the unfixed implementation this class scores <b>3 failures / 1 pass</b>, and the single pass
 * is that control — a standing demonstration of why fixture ordering decides whether these tests prove
 * anything.
