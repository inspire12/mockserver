/**
 * Asserts that enabling control-plane authentication actually DENIES, through every configuration route.
 *
 * <p>Each control-plane authentication mechanism already had a positive test (it works when configured at
 * startup) and no negative test (it actually denies). That asymmetry hid a serious defect: the handler
 * chain was built ONCE during server bootstrap and pushed into {@link HttpState}, so enabling
 * authentication afterwards through any route was accepted — {@code PUT} returned 200, {@code GET} echoed
 * back {@code true} — while {@code HttpState.controlPlaneAuthenticationHandler} stayed {@code null}, and a
 * null handler maps to "authenticated". An operator hardening a running shared/CI instance was told it was
 * locked; it was fully open, including the recorded request log, which in proxy mode holds real captured
 * credentials.
 *
 * <p>This is parameterised over the configuration ROUTES rather than written once per control, because the
 * defect was never in a single control — it was in the assumption that any route reaches the enforcement
 * point. A per-route harness closes the category rather than one instance of it.
 *
 * <p>The {@code PUT /mockserver/configuration} route is exercised end-to-end in the netty module (where
 * that endpoint is served); the DTO route below is the same {@code ConfigurationDTO.applyTo} mutation that
 * endpoint performs.

     * or a developer does, so the flake must not depend on the pom routing alone.
