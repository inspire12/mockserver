/**
 * Ordering regression test for the forward (proxy) paths of {@link HttpActionHandler}: the
 * {@code FORWARDED_REQUEST} log entry MUST be published <em>before</em> the response is written to
 * the client.
 *
 * <p>Why the ordering matters: {@code MockServerEventLog.verify()} / {@code retrieve()} call
 * {@code drainDisruptor()}, which publishes a RUNNABLE marker onto the same FIFO ring buffer and
 * waits for it. That only guarantees visibility of entries <em>already published</em>. If the
 * exchange is written to the client first, a client that receives the forwarded response and
 * immediately verifies (or retrieves recorded requests-and-responses) can race ahead of the log
 * publication and not see the exchange at all. Logging first closes that window — exactly the
 * ordering the mocked-response ({@code EXPECTATION_RESPONSE}) path has always used.
 *
 * <p>How it is asserted: the {@link ResponseWriter} is stubbed so that, at the exact moment the
 * client write happens, it queries the event log for the recorded request-and-response pair — the
 * same public retrieval surface a client would use. Each side appends a marker to a shared list, so
 * the assertion is on the observed <em>sequence</em>, not merely on both events having occurred.
 * Swapping the two statements back to the buggy order turns {@code write(forwarded-request-visible)}
 * into {@code write(forwarded-request-NOT-visible)} and reverses the marker order, failing the test.
 *
 * <p>Determinism comes from the disruptor's FIFO ring buffer rather than from timing, so the test
 * runs with the production {@code asynchronousEventProcessing=true} — the mode in which the race
 * exists. Both the {@code FORWARDED_REQUEST} entry and the retrieval's RUNNABLE marker are published
 * onto the same ring buffer and consumed in publication order, so the probe's answer is fixed by
 * ordering alone: publish-then-retrieve always sees the entry, retrieve-then-publish never does.
 * (Retrieval is inherently disruptor-dispatched — {@code retrieveLogEntries} publishes a RUNNABLE
 * regardless of {@code asynchronousEventProcessing} — so the probe waits on a future rather than
 * sleeping.) The forward itself is driven with {@code synchronous=true} so the write path runs on
 * the test thread.
 *
 * <p>Global state: this test builds its own {@link Configuration}, {@link Scheduler} and
 * {@link MockServerEventLog}, stubs {@link HttpState}, and mutates no JVM-global statics (drift
 * detection is switched off explicitly; chaos is {@code null} so no {@code Metrics} counters are
 * touched, and SLO sampling is a no-op while disabled). It therefore does NOT need registering in
 * the sequential Surefire phase of {@code mockserver-core/pom.xml}.
