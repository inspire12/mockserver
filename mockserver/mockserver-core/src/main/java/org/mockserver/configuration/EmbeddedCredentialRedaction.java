/**
 * Redaction for credentials that live <em>inside</em> a structured configuration value rather than
 * being the whole value.
 *
 * <p>Whole-value credentials are masked by property name — see
 * {@link ConfigurationProperties#isSensitivePropertyName(String)}. That name-keyed mask cannot reach a
 * secret nested in a structured value, of which there are two shapes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a {@code k=v,k2=v2} header list ({@code prometheusRemoteWriteHeaders}), which typically carries
 *       an {@code Authorization} or {@code Api-Key} header;</li>
 *   <li>a JSON document ({@code llmBackendsConfig}, whose documented shape is a <strong>path</strong> to
 *       a backends JSON file — see {@code LlmBackendResolver#namedBackends()} — so in its documented
 *       shape it holds no secret at all; a value that is itself a JSON document is nevertheless redacted
 *       per-field as defence-in-depth).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is applied by <strong>every</strong> surface that discloses a configuration value —
 * {@code GET /mockserver/configuration} (via {@code ConfigurationDTO}), {@code GET /mockserver/config}
 * and {@code --print-config} (via {@link ConfigurationProperties#effectiveConfiguration()}), and the
 * startup property-file log dump — all routed through
 * {@link ConfigurationProperties#redactSensitiveValue(String, String)} so there is ONE notion of what a
 * credential is rather than one per endpoint.
 *
 * <p>Two properties are preserved throughout:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Byte-identical when there is nothing to redact.</strong> Every method returns the
 *       argument itself unless a secret was actually found, so a header list or a file path is
 *       unaffected — masking must not reformat ordinary configuration.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A masked value is never written back, and is never silently discarded either.</strong>
 *       {@code restore*} rebuilds the real value for each masked field from the value already held by
 *       the target, so a {@code GET}-then-{@code PUT} round trip cannot destroy a working credential —
 *       the same guarantee whole-value masking gives, applied per field. Any mask that CANNOT be
 *       resolved — buried inside a value, welded to extra text, in a field that is not
 *       credential-named, or naming a header/backend nothing is held for — makes the WHOLE value
 *       unmergeable: the held value is left untouched and the refusal is logged. Both halves matter.
 *       Writing the mask would make the literal {@code ***REDACTED***} the outbound credential; but
 *       quietly dropping the unresolvable part and writing the remainder deletes the credential just
 *       as effectively, while the enclosing {@code PUT} still answers {@code 200 OK}. Neither is a
 *       state this class will produce.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Unrecognised input fails closed: a sensitively-named JSON field is masked whatever its type
 * (string, number, array, object), and a value that is or merely EMBEDS an unparseable JSON
 * <em>document</em> is masked whole. Nothing here throws.
 *
 * <h2>Known limits of the name-keyed approach</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>A credential inline in a URL is not redacted.</strong> This masks by <em>name</em>
 *       (header name, JSON field name), so a secret carried inside an otherwise non-credential value —
 *       classically {@code "baseUrl":"https://user:p455w0rd@host/v1"} — is returned in clear. Any new
 *       property embedding a secret in a third shape needs its own per-shape treatment; the guard test
 *       is name-keyed and will not catch it automatically.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A header value containing a comma cannot be represented</strong> by the
 *       {@code k=v,k2=v2} format (there is no escape), and the consumer
 *       ({@code PrometheusRemoteWriteExporter#parseHeaders}) drops the tail after the comma. An entry
 *       with no {@code =} is therefore read here as the tail of the preceding value and masked with it,
 *       which is the fail-closed reading but means such an entry is not shown separately. On the way
 *       back, a COMMA-continuation after the mask is split off it and kept alongside the restored
 *       value. Anything else following the mask ({@code ***REDACTED***-my-new-key}) is refused rather
 *       than split: it reads as an operator typing a new credential over the mask, and welding it to
 *       the old value would persist neither the old credential nor the new one.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A plain {@link ObjectMapper} is used deliberately — this walks an anonymous JSON tree and must not
 * depend on the MockServer serializer graph, which itself binds {@code ConfigurationDTO} and would
 * invert the module layering of this package.
