/**
 * Reference-counted pausing of a channel's reads. Several independent handlers can want the same channel's
 * reads paused at once (a parked inbound breakpoint frame, pending WebSocket replies, a TCP chaos latency
 * queue, relay backpressure, a connection delay); toggling {@code autoRead} directly would let the first one
 * to finish turn reading back on while another still needs it off. Auto-read is turned off by the first
 * {@link #pause} and back on only by the {@link #resume} that balances the last one; turning it on makes
 * Netty issue the next read. Every holder on a channel must use this class rather than
 * {@code config().setAutoRead}.
 * <p>
 * Turning auto-read off does not stop a handler from requesting a read itself: a decoder that saw no complete
 * message, or an {@code HttpContentDecoder} left in a WebSocket pipeline, calls {@code ctx.read()} after every
 * read when auto-read is off, which would keep the socket draining. So the first pause also installs a gate at
 * the head of the pipeline that drops read requests while any hold remains.
