/**
 * A chunk sink for streaming response bodies. When MockServer proxies a streaming response
 * (Server-Sent Events or chunked without Content-Length), the response head is delivered
 * immediately while chunks flow through this sink. The sink captures bytes into a bounded
 * buffer (up to {@code maxCaptureBytes}) for the event log / dashboard while forwarding
 * every chunk to the subscribed consumer.
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: {@link #addCompletionListener} may be called from a scheduler thread
 * (e.g. {@code HttpActionHandler.writeStreamingForwardActionResponse}) while
 * {@link #complete()} and {@link #error(Throwable)} are called from the Netty event loop.
 * All mutation of the {@code completed} flag and {@code completionListeners} list is
 * guarded by {@code synchronized(lock)} to ensure a listener is always fired exactly once —
 * immediately if already completed, otherwise when completion/error occurs.
 * <p>
 * The chunk path ({@link #subscribe}, {@link #addChunk}, {@link #complete}, {@link #error})
 * is serialised on the upstream channel's event loop to avoid races between chunk arrival
 * and subscription. Any chunks that arrive before {@code subscribe()} are buffered as
 * {@code byte[]} arrays in a pending list and drained in order when the subscriber connects.
 * <p>
 * Every chunk counts towards {@code maxUnwrittenBytes} from {@link #addChunk} until its subscriber reports it
 * written with {@link #chunkWritten}, including chunks still pending before {@code subscribe()}. Read pacing
 * cannot bound this, because a decoder expands one upstream read synchronously (one read of {@code zstd} can
 * decode to about 2 GiB), so a chunk that takes the total past the bound fails the stream with
 * {@link UnwrittenBytesLimitExceededException} instead.
