/**
 * A bounded {@link ConcurrentLinkedDeque} that evicts the oldest element(s) once it reaches
 * {@code maxSize}, invoking an optional callback on each evicted element.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Why the explicit size counter:</strong> {@link ConcurrentLinkedDeque#size()} is
 * documented as an <em>O(n)</em> operation (it walks the whole list). The eviction check runs
 * on every {@link #add}/{@link #offer}, so relying on {@code super.size()} made each insertion
 * O(n) once the deque was full — the hot path for MockServer's request/event log. Under a
 * sustained request load this manifested as CPU usage that climbed as the log filled and stayed
 * high (GitHub issue #2329). An {@link AtomicInteger} maintained by every mutating method makes
 * {@link #size()} and the eviction check O(1).
 * <p>
 * The counter is kept consistent by every size-changing method on this class
 * ({@link #add}, {@link #offer}, {@link #addAll} (via {@code add}), {@link #remove},
 * {@link #removeItem}, {@link #clear}, and the internal eviction). Callers must mutate the deque
 * only through these methods (MockServer's {@code MockServerEventLog} does); direct use of other
 * inherited bulk mutators is not supported by this subclass.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Optional byte budget:</strong> in addition to the element-count bound, an optional
 * {@code maxBytes} budget can be supplied together with a {@code weigher} (via the 4-arg
 * constructor). Each element's weight is measured by the weigher on insertion and accumulated into
 * {@link #totalBytes}; whenever an insertion would push the running total over {@code maxBytes} the
 * oldest elements are evicted first until it fits (or the deque is empty). This caps the heap held
 * by the event log when individual entries are large (e.g. big LLM-capture bodies) rather than only
 * by entry count. A single element whose weight alone exceeds {@code maxBytes} is still retained —
 * the byte-eviction loop stops once the deque is empty so we never reject the incoming element. The
 * budget is disabled when {@code maxBytes <= 0} or the weigher is {@code null}, in which case the
 * deque behaves exactly as the count-bounded version.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Eviction accounting:</strong> {@link #getEvictedCount()} reports how many elements this
 * deque has silently discarded to stay within its bounds. This deque is the only layer that can
 * distinguish an <em>eviction</em> (evidence lost because the buffer was full) from an intentional
 * {@link #clear()} or a targeted {@link #removeItem(Object)} — both of which invoke the same
 * eviction callback but are deliberate, not lossy. Only {@link #pollAndEvict()} increments the
 * counter; {@link #clear()} resets it, because after an explicit clear the caller has declared the
 * previous contents irrelevant. MockServer's event log surfaces this count so a verification can
 * tell "this never happened" apart from "the evidence was discarded".
