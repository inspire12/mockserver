    // server (e.g. registering a nested expectation via the same MockServerClient); running it inline on
    // the worker event loop, or on the bounded scheduler pool, risks a self-deadlock (the canonical
    // twice-burned regression) or pool starvation under recursion. An unbounded cached pool guarantees
    // that an inner (recursively-triggered) local callback always obtains a fresh thread even when every
    // outer callback thread is blocked waiting on its own loopback — so the wait is always bounded and
    // never a pool-exhaustion deadlock. Threads are reused and reaped after 60s idle, so steady-state
    // cost is the high-water mark of CONCURRENT in-flight blocking callbacks, not a fixed allocation.

    // Dedicated, BOUNDED executor used solely to run RESPONSE_TEMPLATE / FORWARD_TEMPLATE rendering off the
    // server worker event loop and off the shared scheduler pool. Template rendering (Velocity/Mustache/
    // JavaScript) is a synchronous, CPU-bound computation that can take tens of milliseconds. Dispatched
    // through the ordinary Scheduler.schedule path it ran INLINE on the Netty worker event-loop thread when
    // there was no delay (see schedule(): zero delay => run() on the calling thread), or on the bounded
    // shared scheduler pool when a delay was configured. Either way a burst of slow renders monopolised a
    // resource shared with every other action type and stalled unrelated plain-match/forward traffic — the
    // single simultaneous all-arm collapse seen in the live incident. Giving templates their own pool
    // isolates that cost: when renders saturate this pool they queue among THEMSELVES, so the worker event
    // loop and the scheduler pool stay free to serve everything else.
    //
    // BOUNDED, unlike the unbounded localCallbackExecutor. That pool is unbounded to defeat a self-deadlock:
    // a local callback may make a BLOCKING loopback call back to this same server and recursively trigger
    // another local callback, so an inner callback must always obtain a fresh thread. Template rendering does
    // NONE of that — it is a self-contained computation with no loopback and no recursion — so the reason to
    // go unbounded simply does not apply here. For CPU-bound work an unbounded pool is actively worse: it
    // would spawn more concurrent render threads than cores (pure context-switch thrash) and, on a
    // memory-constrained SUT, each extra thread's stack brings the separately-diagnosed response-body
    // retention OOM SOONER rather than later. A fixed pool sized like the scheduler pool
    // (actionHandlerThreadCount() = max(5, cores)) gives full CPU parallelism with a fixed memory ceiling.
    // Each queued render retains its request, response writer and channel until drained, so admission is
    // bounded by maxQueuedTemplateActions (see executeTemplateAction). A render over the bound is answered
    // with the caller's overload response rather than run on the caller's thread: CallerRuns would put the
    // render back on the worker event loop, the pathology this pool exists to remove.
