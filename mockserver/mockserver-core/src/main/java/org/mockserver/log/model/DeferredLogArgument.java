/**
 * A log-message argument that is rendered each time its entry is rendered, and never stored as text: the
 * curl form of a logged request.
 * <p>
 * Storing the rendered String would keep a second copy of the request body on every retained entry, which
 * the event-log byte budget does not count, and would carry every header, cookie, the query string and the
 * body past {@code redactSecretsInLog}, which redacts request objects, not text. So the argument holds the
 * request and address, and {@link LogEntry} renders it from the redacted request wherever the stored String
 * used to appear. The request must not be mutated after the entry is logged; the entry already retains it.
