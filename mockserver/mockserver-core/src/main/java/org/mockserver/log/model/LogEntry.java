     *   NottableStrings and its Body/Headers wrappers.</li>
     * </ul>
     * plus a fixed per-entry structural overhead ({@link #BASE_ENTRY_OVERHEAD_BYTES}) for the LogEntry
     * graph itself, charged only when the entry carries at least one HTTP message (a pure diagnostic
     * entry with no request/response retains almost none of this and stays weightless, so the ring
     * in-flight bound keeps ignoring the overwhelming majority of small control entries), and — only when
     * a REAL expectation has been attached via {@link #setExpectation(Expectation)} — that expectation's
     * own {@link Expectation#estimatedHeapSize()}. A served request's expectation is synthetic and derived
     * lazily (nothing is retained), so it adds nothing; a closest-match expectation attached to a
     * not-matched entry is genuinely retained and is counted.
     * <p>
     * The constants were derived from a live class-histogram (compressed oops) of a filled event log:
     * at {@code WARN} the estimate closely tracks the real retained heap. It errs slightly high for
     * well-known header names (whose shared name instance it does not charge) and can err low for traffic
     * with many custom header names or long distinct paths, whose per-message structure it under-counts.
     * <p>
     * <strong>What is deliberately NOT counted, and why.</strong> The {@code getHttpUpdated*} display
     * copies and the rendered {@code arguments} are transient — recomputed on every call by
     * {@link #getHttpUpdatedRequests(org.mockserver.configuration.Configuration)} /
     * {@link #getHttpUpdatedResponse(org.mockserver.configuration.Configuration)} and never retained on the
     * entry (an argument derived from the entry's own request, such as its curl form, is stored as a
     * {@link DeferredLogArgument} for the same reason) — so they are excluded, as is the memoized
     * {@code message} string. The {@code message} is the one large
     * term that is level-dependent: it is materialized on the retained entry only at a rendering log
     * level ({@code INFO}/{@code DEBUG}/{@code TRACE}, where {@code writeToSystemOut} renders each entry),
     * and it is populated <em>after</em> this weight is first computed and memoized, so it cannot be
     * counted here without either double-counting it at non-rendering levels or making the weight depend
     * on when it happens to be rendered — both of which would break the invariant that the add-time
     * weight equals the evict-time weight exactly. The residual message cost is instead handled at the
     * budget-sizing layer: the in-flight cap's default divisor is tighter at rendering levels, so the
     * whole log stays near a quarter of the heap although kept entries are heavier there — see
     * {@code ConfigurationProperties.defaultEventLogInFlightBytes}. So the
     * estimate has measured at or above real retention at {@code WARN} (a request body shared by an
     * exchange's entries is charged to each of them) and below it at {@code INFO}.
     * <p>
     * Reads the {@code httpRequests} field directly (not {@link #getHttpRequests()}, which substitutes a
     * default request when unset), and all counted terms are stable once the entry is built, so the value
     * never changes after first computation — the byte-budget eviction relies on the add-time weight
     * matching the evict-time weight exactly.
