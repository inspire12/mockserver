/**
 * Process-wide registry of known <em>cassettes</em> — fixture files of MockServer expectations
 * recorded with {@code record_llm_fixtures} or loaded with {@code load_expectations_from_file}.
 *
 * <p>The dashboard's Cassettes tab keeps a per-browser list in {@code localStorage}; this registry
 * is the server-side counterpart so cassettes are also discoverable across page reloads, across
 * browsers, and from automation (e.g. the demo data loader). It holds only lightweight metadata —
 * the cassette's file path, name, expectation count and how it was created — never the file
 * contents themselves. State is held in a {@link ConcurrentHashMap} keyed by file path and is
 * cleared on server reset (see {@code HttpState.reset()}).
 *
 * <p>Exposed over the control plane as {@code GET/PUT/DELETE /mockserver/cassettes}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Registration policy (settled — do not re-open).</strong> A cassette enters this registry
 * from exactly three places, and <em>loading and recording register automatically</em>:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the {@code record_llm_fixtures} MCP tool, when it writes a fixture file (origin {@code "recorded"});</li>
 *     <li>the {@code load_expectations_from_file} MCP tool, when it loads a fixture file (origin {@code "loaded"});</li>
 *     <li>an explicit {@code PUT /mockserver/cassettes}, to track a cassette produced some other way.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The two MCP tools each own the file path and expectation count at the point the file is written/loaded,
 * so they call {@link #register} directly rather than routing through a shared load/record method — there is
 * no such method: recording writes bytes and loading reads them, and they converge only on this registry.
 * A manual {@code PUT} is therefore <em>not</em> required after a load or a record. Every path upserts by
 * file path (see {@link #register}), so re-loading or re-recording the same file updates the existing entry
 * in place rather than duplicating it.
