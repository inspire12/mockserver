/**
 * Stateless retry logic for forwarded/proxied requests. Re-issues a request to its upstream up to
 * {@code maxRetries} times when the previous attempt produced a <b>transient</b> failure — a
 * connection-level exception, or an upstream response of 502/503/504 — provided the HTTP method is
 * <b>idempotent</b>. Non-idempotent methods (POST, PATCH) are never retried, so a request is never
 * silently executed twice.
 *
 * <p>The whole policy is inert when {@code maxRetries <= 0}: {@link #execute} simply returns the
 * first attempt's future, preserving the historical "forward exactly once" behaviour.
 *
 * <p>Retries are chained asynchronously off the supplied future (never blocking the event loop). A
 * linear back-off ({@code backoffMillis * attemptNumber}) is applied between attempts via
 * {@link CompletableFuture#delayedExecutor}.
