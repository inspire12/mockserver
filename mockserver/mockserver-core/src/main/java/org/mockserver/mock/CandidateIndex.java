/**
 * Candidate index for expectation matching above a size threshold.
 *
 * <p><b>Purpose.</b> {@code RequestMatchers.firstMatchingExpectation} scans every
 * registered expectation in global priority/insertion order and returns the first
 * match — pure O(n). For large expectation sets (1k–5k) this dominates the
 * request-serving hot path. This index narrows the scan to a small CANDIDATE set
 * for the request without changing which expectation is returned.
 *
 * <p><b>Hard guarantee — zero behavioural change.</b> The expectation returned for
 * any request is byte-for-byte identical to the full linear scan, including match
 * ORDER (priority + insertion order, first match wins). This holds because:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An expectation is placed in a {@code (method, path)} BUCKET only when both
 *       its method and path are PLAIN LITERAL equality matchers (see
 *       {@link #bucketKeyFor(HttpRequestMatcher, boolean)}); such an expectation can
 *       match a request ONLY when the request's literal {@code (method, path)} equals
 *       the bucket key. Any other request provably fails the method/path criteria
 *       (which are AND-ed in {@code HttpRequestPropertiesMatcher}).</li>
 *   <li>Every expectation that is NOT safely bucketable (regex/notted/blank/optional/
 *       schema/path-parameter method or path, or a non-HTTP request definition) goes
 *       in the FALLTHROUGH list, which is checked on every request.</li>
 *   <li>The candidate set for a request is {@code bucket(requestKey) ∪ fallthrough}.
 *       Any expectation outside this set is in a different literal bucket and so
 *       cannot match the request. Therefore the first match among candidates,
 *       evaluated in the SAME GLOBAL sorted order, equals the first match of the
 *       full scan.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Global-order evaluation.</b> {@link #candidatesInGlobalOrder} returns the
 * candidate matchers sorted by exactly the comparator the backing
 * {@code CircularPriorityQueue} uses ({@link SortableExpectationId#EXPECTATION_SORTABLE_PRIORITY_COMPARATOR}
 * over each matcher's {@code expectation.getSortableId()}). This reproduces the
 * global total order, so a higher-priority fallthrough expectation still wins over
 * a lower-priority bucketed one.
 *
 * <p><b>Incremental (per-mutation) maintenance — G1.</b> The index is maintained
 * INCREMENTALLY: {@link #onAdded}/{@link #onRemoved} update one bucket in O(1) as each
 * matcher enters or leaves the store. They are driven by a mutation listener the
 * {@code RequestMatchers} wires onto the backing {@code CircularPriorityQueue}, so every
 * structural mutation (add, remove, in-place update, priority re-key, overflow eviction,
 * reset) is reflected without a full rebuild. A read NEVER rebuilds — it reads a small
 * candidate set directly. This replaces the earlier generation-driven
 * rebuild-on-read-after-any-mutation design, which under continuous churn (the serving
 * path itself schedules lazy removal of {@code once()} / limited-{@code Times} matchers)
 * forced every request to rebuild the whole index AND the full sorted list — O(n) per
 * request and, being {@code synchronized}, serialising concurrent readers so it worsened
 * with cores. The incremental index is flat under churn and touches no shared lock on the
 * read path.
 *
 * <p><b>An in-place update that re-buckets is correct.</b> {@code RequestMatchers} performs
 * an in-place update as {@code removePriorityKey(matcher)} (the matcher still holds its OLD
 * method/path) then, after {@code matcher.update(newExpectation)}, {@code addPriorityKey(matcher)}
 * (now the NEW method/path). The listener maps these to {@link #onRemoved} (removes the id from
 * its OLD placement, looked up via the {@code locator} — never recomputed) then {@link #onAdded}
 * (places the id into its NEW bucket). The id is invariant across the update, so the move is exact
 * regardless of whether the bucket key changed.
 *
 * <p><b>Case mode.</b> Bucket keys are folded with {@code toLowerCase(ROOT)} when matching is
 * case-insensitive ({@code matchExactCase} off). The fold in force is fixed for the maintained
 * index and stored on the published {@link State}. A read that observes a different case mode
 * (a live {@code matchExactCase} change) triggers a one-off {@link #rebuild} from the
 * authoritative sorted snapshot under the index monitor — rare, and it never spans the scan.
 *
 * <p><b>Threading contract.</b> Mirrors {@code RequestMatchers}: control-plane mutations are
 * single-writer, and {@link #onAdded}/{@link #onRemoved}/{@link #rebuild} serialise on the index
 * monitor so a data-plane {@link #rebuild} can never race a writer. Reads
 * ({@link #candidatesInGlobalOrder}) run lock-free on data-plane threads over the published
 * {@link State} (a {@code volatile} reference to concurrent maps) and are eventually consistent —
 * a read concurrent with an in-flight mutation may not yet reflect it, exactly as the CPQ's
 * {@code toSortedList()} snapshot is.

     *
     * <p><b>Direction.</b> Unlike the data-plane read, the clear's request is the MATCHER and each

     *
     * <p><b>Soundness.</b> When the clear carries a pure-ASCII literal path, the reverse path match
     * reduces to literal (folded) equality against any other literal path (both sides are
     * regex-metacharacter-free, so as-regex each matches only itself), so an expectation in a
     * DIFFERENT literal-path bucket provably fails the clear's path criterion. Every expectation
     * whose path is NOT a plain literal lives in the {@code pathFallthrough} and is ALWAYS included
     * — that covers a regex-path expectation a literal clear still removes (bidirectional match),
     * and every notted/blank/schema/path-parameter path. Extra clear constraints (a literal method,
     * headers, query, body) only make it MORE selective and are still applied by the full reverse
     * match the caller runs on each returned candidate, so they never cause an under-removal.
     *
     * <p><b>Shapes.</b>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>literal path + literal method → the one {@code (method,path)} bucket ∪ {@code fallthrough}
     *       (the tighter set; a foreign method sits in a different (method,path) bucket);</li>
     *   <li>literal path + any non-literal method (absent/blank/regex/notted) → the one path bucket
     *       ∪ {@code pathFallthrough} (method imposes no bucket constraint);</li>
     *   <li>anything else (non-literal path, path parameters, a non-HTTP clear) → {@code null},

     * </ul>
     * The clear's literal path/method come from {@link #literalValue}, which already rejects
     * non-ASCII, so no non-ASCII case-fold fallback is needed here (a non-ASCII expectation path is
     * itself in the path fallthrough and always included).
     *
     * <p><b>Case mode.</b> The control-plane clear matcher is ALWAYS case-insensitive, independent
     * of {@code matchExactCase} (see {@code HttpRequestPropertiesMatcher}, where
     * {@code caseSensitive = !controlPlaneMatcher && matchExactCase} is false for any clear filter).
     * So narrowing is only possible against a case-insensitively folded index, which exists only
     * when {@code matchExactCase} is OFF ({@code caseInsensitiveNow == true}); with exact-case ON we
     * return {@code null} (full scan) rather than under-remove against case-sensitive buckets. This
     * is the opposite of the data-plane read, whose index fold tracks {@code matchExactCase}.
     *
     * <p>Order is irrelevant — a clear removes EVERY match, not the first — so the union is returned
     * unsorted. A live {@code matchExactCase} flip to OFF is handled by a one-off {@link #rebuild}
     * to the case-insensitive fold under the monitor before the lookup.
     *
     * @param caseInsensitiveNow {@code !configuration.matchExactCase()} — true when the (case-
     *                           insensitive) clear can be served by the case-insensitively folded
     *                           index; false forces the full scan
     * @return the candidate matchers to run the full reverse match against, or {@code null} to mean
