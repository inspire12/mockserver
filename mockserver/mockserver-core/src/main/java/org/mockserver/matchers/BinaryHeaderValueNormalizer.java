/**
 * Padding-insensitive comparison support for gRPC binary metadata header values.
 * <p>
 * <strong>The contract.</strong> The gRPC wire format requires the value of any metadata key whose
 * name ends {@code -bin} to be base64. MockServer treats a {@code -bin} value as <em>already
 * base64-encoded by the user</em> and passes it through unchanged in both directions — it never
 * encodes or decodes. Base64 is pure ASCII, so the value survives every transport site unaltered
 * (US-ASCII gRPC-Web trailers, CR/LF header sanitisation, HPACK/QPACK, JSON serialisation).
 * <p>
 * <strong>The one place pass-through is not enough: matching.</strong> grpc-java encodes outbound
 * binary metadata with {@code BASE64_ENCODING_OMIT_PADDING}
 * ({@code io.grpc.internal.TransportFrameUtil#toHttp2Headers}), so the value that actually arrives
 * on the wire has <em>no</em> {@code =} padding — {@code AQIDBA}, not {@code AQIDBA==}. A user who
 * writes the natural, padded form produced by {@code Base64.getEncoder()} in an expectation would
 * otherwise silently fail to match every real gRPC client. Both forms decode to identical bytes and
 * are therefore the same value, so the matcher compares them with the padding removed.
 * <p>
 * Normalisation is deliberately narrow:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It applies only when the header <em>name</em> ends {@code -bin} (case-insensitively), so
 *       ordinary HTTP header matching is untouched.</li>
 *   <li>It applies only to header maps, not to query-string or path parameters.</li>
 *   <li>It strips trailing {@code =} only from a <em>structurally valid</em> padded base64 value —
 *       base64 alphabet characters, one or two {@code =}, and a total length that is a multiple of 4.
 *       A JSON-schema matcher is never touched. Note that {@code +} and {@code /} are base64
 *       alphabet characters as well as regex metacharacters, so a regex is left as written only when
 *       it fails that structural test; the length invariant is what makes the common metacharacter
 *       case ({@code A+=}) safe. See {@link #stripPaddingIfPaddedBase64}.</li>
 *   <li>Both the matcher side and the matched side are normalised through the same function, so the
 *       comparison stays symmetric and a padded expectation matches a padded actual value just as it
 *       did before.</li>
 * </ul>
