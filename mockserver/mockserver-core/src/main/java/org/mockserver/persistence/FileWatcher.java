     * Streamed through a small fixed buffer rather than {@code Files.readAllBytes}, because this runs
     * on every poll whether or not the file changed. Materialising the whole file allocated a byte[]
     * the size of the file each time: for a 10 MB initialization file at the default 5 s period that
     * is ~364 MB of garbage every three minutes, and in G1 each of those arrays is a <em>humongous</em>
     * allocation. Measured on an idle server with no traffic at all, watching turned that from
     * <b>zero</b> collections into a heap repeatedly filling to ~230 MB of a 256 MB heap and being
     * collected. Buffered, the same poll allocates 64 KB.
     * <p>
     * The arithmetic is deliberately {@link Arrays#hashCode(byte[])}'s, computed incrementally, so the
     * fingerprint is unchanged from the previous implementation — though nothing depends on that, since
     * the value is only ever compared against another reading of the same file. What the contract
     * actually requires is that it is stable for unchanged content and differs for changed content,
     * including a change in the final byte of a multi-chunk file and a change confined to a byte above
     * 0x7F, both of which a chunked loop can get wrong and are pinned by tests.
