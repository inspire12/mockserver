# Assert the baked AppCDS archive (/mockserver.jsa) is ACTUALLY MAPPED at runtime,
# not merely present on disk. The image build only does `ls -l /mockserver.jsa`
# (existence), and the entrypoint runs the JVM default -Xshare:auto, under which a
# missing / corrupt / bind-mounted-away / arch-mismatched archive logs a warning and
# starts normally — silently giving back the measured ~34% startup win (855ms -> 566ms,
# 7.3.1-SNAPSHOT, 2026-07-02) with nothing anywhere failing.
#
# The compose file forces -Xshare:on via JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS. Under -Xshare:on the JVM
# ABORTS initialisation when the archive cannot be mapped, so the server never binds and
# never becomes ready. This makes readiness a clean BOOLEAN proof the archive mapped:
# no wall-clock timing is parsed, so the check cannot be flaky and can safely block a
# merge. -Xlog:cds additionally lets us confirm the DYNAMIC /mockserver.jsa archive
# mapped (not just the base CDS archive), which also guards the entrypoint wiring.
