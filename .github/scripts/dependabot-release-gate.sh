# Release-side hook for the Dependabot auto-merge RELEASE-IN-FLIGHT gate.
#
# The auto-merge workflow (.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml) stands
# down while the repository variable RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS holds a recent epoch
# timestamp, so routine dependency bumps do not auto-merge into master while a
# release is being cut. This script is the ONLY writer of that variable: the
# release pipeline calls it to `set` the flag at the start (prepare) and `clear`
# it at the end (finalize) AND from a failure trap.
#
# WHY THIS LIVES HERE, not under scripts/release/: it is a GitHub-side control
# (it writes a GitHub Actions repository variable read by a GitHub Actions
# workflow), so it belongs beside the workflow it serves. The release scripts
# merely invoke it. Wiring points (on the release side):
#   * prepare stage / start of a real (non-dry-run) release:  set
#   * finalize stage:                                         clear
#   * a trap on the release runner so an ABORTED release also clears:  clear
# The workflow's own max-age backstop (default 12h) is the last-resort safety
# net for the case where even the failure-trap clear does not run.
#
# TOKEN: writing a repository variable is a GitHub Actions resource and needs a
# token in GH_TOKEN that can write Actions variables — a classic PAT needs the
# `repo` scope, a fine-grained PAT the "Variables: read and write" repository
# permission. The release loads a GitHub PAT from the
# `mockserver-release/github-token` secret (see scripts/release/_lib.sh).
#
# MEASURED REALITY — the gate is INERT today. That PAT is fine-grained and does
# NOT currently carry the Variables permission: it returns HTTP 403 on the
# /actions/variables API (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE alike). So every `set`/`clear`
# here fails the write, and this script shouts LOUDLY — a delimited INERT block
# on BOTH stdout and stderr, and (under Buildkite) a red `dependabot-release-gate`
# annotation — while STILL exiting 0 so the release proceeds. The gate stays
# inert until someone adds "Variables: read and write" to that fine-grained PAT.
# The auto-merge workflow does NOT need this token: it READS the value from the
# `vars` context at render time, which requires no token and no permission.
#
# Reads/writes are idempotent and NEVER fail the release: a gate hiccup must not
# abort a release, and a stranded flag self-expires via the workflow backstop.
#
# GH RUNNER — how the `gh` call is executed, resolved once at startup in order:
#   1. $GATE_GH_CMD  — an explicit runner override (word-split into a command
#      prefix). The release wiring in scripts/release/_lib.sh sets this to the
#      containerised form `in_docker "$GH_IMAGE" --entrypoint gh --secret-env
#      GH_TOKEN --`, because the release-queue AMI installs NO host `gh` (its
#      bootstrap installs no packages), so a bare host `gh` would leave the gate
#      permanently inert. The token is staged as a 0600 file and exported only
#      into gh's own process, so it never appears on any argv, in `docker
#      inspect` or in the container's PID 1 environment.
#   2. host `gh` on PATH — the standalone / local path (run it directly).
#   3. neither — NO runner. This is itself a write failure: it takes the SAME
#      loud INERT path with a REASON that names the missing runner, so it can be
#      neither mistaken for a clean run nor confused with a 403.
# The HOST always decides and annotates (buildkite-agent is a host binary);
# only the `gh` call itself is delegated to the runner.
#
# Usage:
#   GH_TOKEN=... dependabot-release-gate.sh set     # at release start
#   GH_TOKEN=... dependabot-release-gate.sh clear    # at finalize + failure trap
#   GH_TOKEN=... dependabot-release-gate.sh status   # print current value
#   GATE_GH_CMD='in_docker <image> --entrypoint gh --secret-env GH_TOKEN --' … # containerised runner
#
# REPO defaults to this repository; override via the REPO env var.

================================================================================
  DEPENDABOT RELEASE GATE: INERT — auto-merge is NOT being held for this release
================================================================================
  Could not write the GitHub Actions repository variable '$VAR' on '$REPO'.

  CONSEQUENCE: Dependabot auto-merge is NOT paused. Dependency bumps CAN
  auto-merge into master while this release is being cut. (The auto-merge
  workflow's max-age backstop still bounds any stranded flag, but right now
  NO hold is in effect.)

  REASON: $1

  API EVIDENCE:
$2

  REMEDY: the release PAT at 'mockserver-release/github-token' cannot write
  Actions variables. Add the "Variables: read and write" repository permission
  to that fine-grained PAT (a classic PAT needs the 'repo' scope). Until then
  this gate stays inert and this notice repeats on every release.
