  // the offered 901: when the server contends it falls, and residence LENGTHENS
  // WITHOUT BOUND (2×/4×/10× → ∞ as achieved rps → 0), scaling every figure above
  // with it. That is not hypothetical — build #249 died exactly here: the JavaScript
  // contagion (since fixed) depressed throughput, residence blew up, the MB bodies
  // stacked across the http→https_h2 passes, and the container OOMed before the second
  // pass could seed. The 2026-09-17 dispatch-pool fixes (eec183f7e/7fbae1350) make it
  // WORSE, not better: freeing the pool admits MORE body throughput. So a per-arm rate
  // is the WRONG lever — no rate keeps r × residence × B bounded once residence runs
  // away. RETENTION is bounded at the SERVER instead: maxEventLogSizeInBytes, a body-byte
  // budget on by default (the main SUT runs at the shipped heap-derived value, the other
  // SUTs at a fixed 256 MiB), evicts oldest-first so TOTAL retained body bytes never
  // exceed the budget REGARDLESS of residence. These rates stay low only to
  // keep per-arm CPU/GC contention on the core-limited SUT modest (so they don't shift
  // the historical arms' latencies) and the run length bounded — NOT as the OOM guard.
  // The warmup NEVER touches these arms (regression.js excludes them from warmupOp),
  // so nothing accumulates before measurement either.
  // `growth` needs the default ~115,500-entry ring to fill (issue #2329 O(n) eviction),

  // transient that exceeds a rung's pool is DROPPED (counted) rather than
  // compounding into a connection storm.
  //
  // WHY PER RUNG, NOT ONE FLAT POOL — the trap a single number falls into on a
  // 500 -> 64,000 CI ladder (build #347; the CI ladder tops at 64k via
  // perf-test-run.sh, not the 32k local default above):
  //   * rig_valid (perf-test-run.sh) requires dropped_iterations == 0. A pool
  //     sized for the LOW rungs (e.g. a flat 512) would undersize a near-knee rung
  //     the server can still serve CLEANLY, making it drop -> flip from rig-valid
  //     to rig-invalid -> silently lower rig_valid_peak_achieved_rps and the
  //     published knee. A pool sized for the TOP rung (e.g. a flat 4,000) would
  //     open thousands of connections on the trusted low rungs — the storm the
  //     invariant exists to prevent, corrupting their latency.
  //   * So the pool SCALES with the rung's offered rate, floored and capped:
  //       pool = clamp(ceil(rate * vuPerRps), vuFloor, vuCeiling)
  //     The factor is DERIVED from the measured ramped peaks, not guessed. Their
  //     peak/rate ratios FALL as rate rises (build #347): 34/500=0.068,
  //     128/2000=0.064, 216/4000=0.054, 301/8000=0.038, 1283/32000=0.040. A single
  //     linear factor is therefore dominated by the low rungs, so vuPerRps is taken
  //     from the WORST (highest) ratio 0.068 plus ~18% margin => 0.08. That makes
  //     the factor alone clear every measured peak; the floor and ceiling are then
  //     pure safety. A fixed pool cannot exceed the ramped peak (no storm to
  //     compound), so the measured peaks are an UPPER bound on real fixed-pool
  //     demand and the margins below are conservative.
  //   * vuFloor 96 covers the low rungs the factor would otherwise leave marginal.
  //     500 (measured peak 34) and 1,000 (UNMEASURED; interpolated 65-81 between
  //     the 500 and 2,000 rows) both floor to 96 — above 81 with margin. 64 was too
  //     low for 1k, so it was raised.
  //   * vuCeiling 2048 caps k6 pre-initialisation (k6 pre-inits the peak sum of the
  //     pools of rungs whose reservations overlap — see sweep.js
  //     plannedVusBaseline) on the high rungs, where the falling ratio makes
  //     a flat 0.08 over-provision (32k -> 2560, 48k -> 3840, 64k -> 5120). 2048
  //     still exceeds the 32,000 rung's measured peak (1,283) with ~60% margin, and
  //     48k/64k sit above the ~36k knee so they saturate and are EXCLUDED from
  //     rig_valid regardless of pool.
  //   * PER-RUNG MARGIN (pool vs measured[M]/interpolated[I] ramped peak):
  //       500 -> 96  vs 34[M]        (+182%)
  //       1,000 -> 96 vs ~65-81[I]   (+18-48%; interpolated, no #347 row)

  //     Every MEASURED rung is covered with >=25% margin; the two interpolated
  //     rungs (1k, 16k) are flagged as such with their basis.
  //   * SAFETY CLAIM (narrow and correct): every rung's pool EXCEEDS that rung's
  //     measured (or interpolated) peak demand, so no measured rung is under-served;
  //     and a FIXED pool cannot compound a storm the way the old ramp did, so it
  //     removes the storm-induced drops. (It is NOT claimed that 2048 <= old 4,000
  //     makes this "less rig-limiting" — a lower ceiling could in principle give a
  //     rung fewer VUs than the old ramp could allocate; the coverage-with-margin
  //     above is what makes it safe, not the ceiling comparison.)
  //   * HONEST RESIDUAL: the recorded per-rung demand at 32k-64k is
  //     storm-contaminated (it came from the very ramp being removed), so the CLEAN
  //     fixed-pool residence at those rungs is unmeasured. The reasoning shows the

// (Scheduler: a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor sized actionHandlerThreadCount()).
// The concern the plan raises is that many concurrent streams flood that small
// pool with delayed writeEvent tasks; when the pool cannot service them on time
// the per-token timing DRIFTS (a fidelity loss, because the streaming feature's
// correctness claim IS a timing claim) and the writeAndFlush each task hands to
// a Netty event loop adds event-loop pressure that a concurrent plain `match`
// pays for. This scenario drives that concurrency and measures the fallout.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES vs WHAT THE RUN STEP MEASURES. k6 cannot read an SSE
// body incrementally (http.get buffers the whole response), so k6 here does two
// things it CAN do honestly: (1) SUSTAIN the concurrency — a constant-VUs arm
// where each VU holds one long-lived GET /stream open, so ~concurrency streams
// are always in flight; and (2) the within-run match A/B (item 12's 4th metric)
// — a fixed-rate `match` arm measured FIRST alone (baseline) and then AGAIN
// while the streams run (under load), so the p95 ratio shows whether streaming
// steals the hot path. The two fidelity/retention metrics k6 cannot see are
// taken server-side by perf-test-run.sh: inter-token delay error via a dedicated
// single-stream timing reader (tools/sse-fidelity-reader.py) run idle THEN under
// this load (the idle run is the client-jitter FLOOR / positive control that
// proves the error growth is the server, not the reader), and heap-per-open-
// stream via the metrics-endpoint heap FLOOR sampled with the streams open minus
// an idle baseline.
//
// MEASURED-WINDOW HYGIENE — cloned from the FIXED regression.js shape (Finding 3,
// post-2026-09-16): staggered scenario starts, preAllocatedVUs == maxVUs (no
// mid-run allocation) on the fixed-rate arms, a settle exclusion tagged
// op:<op>_settle, MIN_TAIL_SAMPLES tail suppression, and the heavy/warm load-time
// contract. The STREAMING arm is `heavy` (no warm): warming it at the ~warmup
// rate would open thousands of long-lived streams at once (a connection + log
// storm), so it is deliberately not warmed — it is the load, not a measured-
// latency arm, and its cold first cohort lands in the excluded settle window.

// recorded bodies). Every matched stream request is recorded in MockServer's
// count-bounded event-log ring (maxLogEntries entries, holding the request + the

// residence ≈ maxLogEntries / total_offered_rps seconds — which LENGTHENS as
// total rps falls, so a low stream-start rate does NOT help retention, it hurts.
// On the 2 GB CI SUT maxLogEntries = min(heapKB/8, 250000) ≈ 115,500. Stream-start

// ≈ 115500/225 ≈ 510 s (the ring does not fill inside the window). Retained
