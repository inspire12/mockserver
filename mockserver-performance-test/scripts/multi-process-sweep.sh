# multi-process-sweep.sh — a load generator that can SATURATE the server, so
# the performance programme can finally answer item 18's open question:
# "why does a single k6 process drop iterations with three quarters of its VU
# pool unused, and is the flat ~6,000 rps healthy ceiling a CLIENT limit or a
# SERVER limit?" (docs/plans/performance-programme.md, item 18 + "item 18's
# experiment" row in "What remains").
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the evidence it is built to act on).
#   * The per-core serving curve (perf-percore.sh) is flat at ~6,000 rps for
#     C = 1,2,4,8 and NEITHER side is CPU-bound: the SUT draws ~one core's worth
#     at every C and the single k6 used ~2 of its 7-14 disjoint cores.
#   * A native re-run (M3 Max) killed the two obvious server-side explanations:
#     the server reached 30,704 rps at 317% CPU when driven hard (NOT
#     single-threaded-limited), containerisation costs ~10% not 5x, and
#     disabling the event log changed peak throughput not at all.
#   * Yet the single k6's HEALTHY (no-drops) ceiling was 4,000-8,000 rps — the
#     same order as CI's 6,000 — while the server was nowhere near saturated and
#     k6's VU pool was 3/4 idle (vus_concurrent_overall_max 669 of 4,000).
#
# A flat curve with neither side CPU-bound is the shape of a COORDINATION /
# SERIALISATION limit, not a capacity limit. The single most likely locus, on
# that evidence, is INSIDE one k6 process (its arrival-rate executor + metrics
# pipeline + Go GC), NOT the server. This harness tests that directly by
# splitting the offered load across N INDEPENDENT k6 processes pinned to
# disjoint cores and asking whether the AGGREGATE clean ceiling rises with N.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES (and how it discriminates client-limit from server-limit).
# For each process count N in $PERF_MULTI_PROCS (default 1,2,4) it drives the
# SAME aggregate offered-rate ladder ($PERF_MULTI_AGG_RATES), split N ways so
# each process offers agg/N, all N running in the SAME wall-clock window, and
# records PER PROCESS and in AGGREGATE:
#   * offered vs achieved, per process AND aggregated (Sum, never double-counted
#     — each process offers a disjoint share of the arrival rate);
#   * dropped_iterations per process and summed — the client-shortfall signal;
#   * client CPU PER PROCESS and the SUT CPU, both sampled from one docker-stats
#     call, so "neither side is CPU-bound" is RE-TESTED at the new load rather
#     than asserted (the native run never recorded client CPU — this closes that
#     gap, which is exactly the flaw the programme keeps hitting: an instrument
#     that measures the wrong subject);
#   * a per-N `limited_by` verdict AND a top-level `scaling` verdict.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR (the whole point — the old instrument could not tell you
# WHY it stopped). A flat single-process curve cannot separate "client cannot
# offer more" from "server cannot serve more". This one can:
#   * aggregate clean ceiling RISES ~linearly with N, SUT CPU climbing toward
#     its pin  => the ceiling was a PER-PROCESS CLIENT limit; more processes
#     help; report the new, higher server-side ceiling.
#   * aggregate clean ceiling FLAT regardless of N, per-process achieved FALLING
#     as ~agg/N, BOTH sides with CPU headroom => a SHARED-PATH limit (loopback /
#     veth / the SUT accept path / a server-internal serialisation) — more
#     client processes on THIS host will NOT help; you need multiple client
#     HOSTS or the limit is server-internal. The harness SAYS which, it does not
#     assume.
#   * any process pinned AT its client-CPU pin => that process was client-CPU
#     -bound; its rungs are excluded as server figures (client_cpu_at_pin).
#
# NOT A GATE. This harness only measures. It emits a self-describing JSON block
# (stdout, or the file named by $1). CI wiring (an env-gated call + a NON-gating
# compare key) is described in the script header comment `CI WIRING` below and
# is intentionally NOT done here — perf-test-run.sh / perf-test-compare.sh /
# perf-budgets.json are owned by a concurrent change.
#

# `serving_multiproc_aggregate_healthy_ceiling_rps` and
# `serving_multiproc_scales_with_procs`. Do not re-add that wiring.
